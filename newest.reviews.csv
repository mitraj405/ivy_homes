The first thing I noticed was the radial blur filter laid over half the scenes. Things at the top and bottom of the screen are blurred out for no reason other than to draw attention to what they want you looking at. I couldn't even make it an hour into the film.\nThe battle scenes, while decently choreographed, were almost entirely bloodless. Stab someone? No blood. No hole. Shoot someone? No blood. No hole.\nGravity doesn't seem to exist. With a gas giant as your neighbor in the night sky you'd think that would effect all sorts of things including the physiology of the people, animals, plants, and tides.\nI can't understand how someone could proof read this script and give it a seal of approval.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,

After the really bad opening exposition, we're greeted with some really good imagery that is ruined by the horrible creature design of just a Clydesdale horse with a piece of driftwood stuck to its head. But wait, it gets worse once the humans start acting.\nNo amount of Lens flare can hide the poor writing and bad acting of this movie, though Mr Snyder sure does try. It's almost like someone is making fun of him. The mishmash of cool imagery and stupid imagery just left me feeling confused; why are some shots really great, and others really bad and confusing? Why are some aliens cool, but some are just a horse with driftwood on its head?!\nThe writing is bad, the pacing is off, and the characters are so flat they disappear when turned sideways.

The costuming and practical sets are excellent. The casting is perfectly good, the acting is good considering the appalling dialogue and story. Unfortunately the whole effort is spoiled by a complete lack of effort on the part of the writers. The ""recruitment story"" is soo completely contrived. ( dues ex machina?? ) the characters are brutally shoe-horned into the story with almost no effort to weave them in organically. I hate to be mean, but it feels like a 15 year old boy wrote the story and dialogue (and noone proof read it for him). Looking back on Jack Snyder's writing credits before this, there is a predicable string of woefully scripted movies (in terms of dialog), wonder woman, 300, justice league etc... Its a real shame if he had employed some skilled writers it could have been a really great sci-fi film.

If you grew up watching the kind of movies that eventually got turned into MST3K episodes, you might be able to finish it. Honestly if the Walking Dead had continued at it's same steady decline in quality this is like what season 38 would be. It is that bad.\nThose people who give it positive reviews are the people who dug their heels in arguing that Zack Snyder is a director who knows what he's doing. And after all those years they can't admit that they were wrong.\nThere is going to be a director's cut that fills in the major holes in the plot and story, but the damage is done. Watching it with vital information cut out of it for no reason, make it a confusing, jumbled mess of 1/2 ideas with poor execution.

And then lower them some more.\nI had high hopes for this movie given Zack Snyder's track record with action and superhero films but this one is out of his grasp. Just like the Star Wars franchise falls from grace, so does this strange ensemble of scenes that were slapped together to make this a so-called movie. At first glance, the casting is appealing but I'm not sure this movie did anyone any favors (aside from pushing them to get ripped so they at least look good on screen). The story and movie itself lacked depth and was overall just weak. It's almost like they sat in a room and said ""so we've done 50 shades of Star Wars, Divergent, Game of Thrones, The Avengers, but what if we try to combine themes from each series and then pepper in some Fifth Element vibes?!"" Also, the fight sequences were terrible. Don't get me wrong, I know it's all fiction, but the reaction time during fight scenes was so unbelievable and the major fight scenes were all borrowed from other movies.\nI'm sure there is certain pressure to bring ""the next best thing"" to our screens when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy film and space opera but this ain't it. And it certainly doesn't make me eager to watch part 2. Zack Snyder needs to take a seat, sit back, and chill on this one.\nConclusion: go watch Dune.

A lot of what I liked about this film had to do with the visuals and sound, but I was also happy with the character utilization and development that was offered.\nThere's a lot of flair going on when it comes to the fighting. It doesn't contain the most exhilarating fighting sequences, but it's enough to get my heart racing. While at times they're over the top in terms of what damage can be done to a superhero before they're exhausted. They're still entertaining and spread out enough throughout the film to keep me interested.\nI loved the soundtrack that went along with the film. It truly enhances the film to greater heights. The intensity of what happens next. The pulsation of the next attack. All of it go hand in hand with the music.\nVisually, this film is more toned down in terms of colour, but not in the vibrance or darkness when needed. With all the sea creatures that exist, the explosions that occur, and the unreal made real. This film does a perfect job in my eyes in maintaining the integrity of realism for things that are always easy to do, or are always skimmed over.\nI enjoyed the character utilization and development compared to the first film especially for Patrick Wilson. I didn't like him in the first film, but with better screen time here I do. As a character you can't remove Mera because of the important role she has, but her screen time seems to be less.\nThe story isn't great, but it's not boring. Some aspects seem silly and others unnecessary, but it works out in the end. It's not as clear cut as I would like, but I can still follow what is being put down.\nOverall, it's still worth checking out, but not in 3D. I know ""Lost Kingdom"" is getting a lot of mediocre reviews, but it's not the worse superhero movie ever. Good visuals, great music, and enjoyable character development are what has really drawn me in.\nThat's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time....

And despite Arthur narrating the events of the first film in the first seconds there is not much time for people who didn't watch it to know them and most of the sad moments feel fake and you can't really relate to the characters.

Besides the narrative, that Aquaman has a family now and is a not so conventional king, there is not much exposition which introduce into the movie. The story is a standard fantasy plot, not really good, but not that bad. However, using the same antagonist from the first movie a second time feels uninspired and boring.

Yes the special effects were impressive and there were a few funny jokes but other than that the story was dull and confusing. They did try to help by having a narrator poke in every once and awhile but flow of the movie was rather disjointed. Several times I looked down on my phone to see the how much long I hand before this mess of a film was over. Look I like Jason but even Arnold is a better actor. Again while the special effects were good there was too much of it. OK this movie is turning over to be a flop just as the recent Ant Man flopped. Both I believe suffered from too much CGI. I feel that the reason that people are fatigued over these Super Hero movies that there's nothing new. Many parts of the script seems like a rip-off of Star Wars movie.

It felt like James Wan and the crew really knew they had nothing to offer so they just did not care at all about what was happening in the film. They just did whatever they wanted and it came out to be a rather hilarious spectacle to me.\nIt's kind of hard to talk about the humongous stupidity in the movie without spoiling it but trust me when I say nothing feels like it's being taken seriously. The plot points all just feel thrown in from other things, the weirdest and most prevalent thing would be some things that feel directly from the World of Warcraft universe...???\nThe acting and delivery made me laugh a lot. It was bad across the board, but I didn't think Jason Mamoa or Patrick Wilson were bad. They seemed like he was trying along with Nicole Kidman though she wasn't in the movie much. Amber Heard and Randall Park were both very 1 dimensional and were unbelievable in every single scene they were in. Manta was very over the top and often made me laugh when he was on screen. It was stupid. Dolph Lundgren was TERRIBLE, every line he delivered was as if he was an amateur they picked up off the street, it did not seem like he wanted to be there.\nThe forced dramatic parts in this movie essentially border on parody. They did a low framerate slowdown during an incredibly overdramatic melodrama sequence that just came out of nowhere. It was very funny. I know a lot of people are having issues with this but given the tone of the entire movie (which was inconsistent by the way) it felt like a lot of this insanity was completely intentional. I'm not saying its not stupid, I'm saying I was busting up laughing in the theater.\nI liked some of the fight scenes to be honest. Barring the first one which was actually very bad, basically it felt like this blue cgi mess and was just all the same color pigment, so it was just very hard to keep track of anything that is happening. The desert fight was not bad, I enjoyed the choreography in that scene and thought that was probably the best scene in the movie. Though there was a comical scene in that fight scene involving Patrick Wilson that I just couldn't deal with, it was so funny to me.\nThere were scenes in the movie that were intended to make you laugh that I like, actually intentionally unironically laughed at. I think they were a little low on the joke tierlist but this movie's jokes did tickle my fancy occasionally. I was definitely never bored watching this movie.\nOverall most of this movie just made me laugh because of how stupid it was all the time. It felt like a video game so often. It felt like nobody cared about the seriousness of what they were doing, and it just feels like watching a ridiculoustrainwreck and personally I'm all for it. I find it incredibly engaging. If something very stupid and over the top does not interest you, probably stay away from this movie, as it really does not offer much outside that element.\nLow 4/10 or High 3/10\nPS. I know this may seem like a high score for how much I talked poorly about this film, but I again... I really cannot preface how much I had a great time watching this movie.

I am tired of seeing the classic heroic Bollywood movies where the hero can never be wrong. Vanga truly uncovers a beast.\nRanbir Kapoor is shown to be an ""animal"", with some signs showing in his childhood and teenage years but really unraveling in his adulthood after a major incident. From then on, what Ranbir does is beyond imaginable. Ranbir is not shown to be a hero - he does barbaric things, goes back on his words, and doesn't respect anyone in his life. Folks who are crying about Ranbir's role really think all movie heroes are to be admired.\nEveryone's acting was phenomenal. Bobby Deol was GREAT, what a comeback. The interval sequence was a pleasure to watch, even though I am usually not a big fan of large action sequences. The music is great.\nI just wish the second half was not as dragged. I am not a big fan of Tripti Dimri's sequence. It was unnecessary and only added for the sequel.

The story is quite basic about two families who hate each other and the film has some very graphics scenes that you don't normally see in Bollywood films (not suitable for under 18s). So if you're expecting typical Bollywood fare then this film doesn't provide it and I understand the low ratings are probably being given for these reasons.\nHowever, the acting of the star cast is excellent. Ranbir puts in a powerhouse performance and absolutely nails every scene. He handles the action and psychotic scenes incredibly well. But Bobby Deol outshines even Ranbir with his shorter and more intense performance. It is without doubt the best acting performance of Bobby's career. His entry scene to the Jamal Jamaloo song is superb and he steals the show with his dance steps that leave a lasting impression, as well as his emotional and action scenes. The performance of all the other cast is also top notch. The film is also well mounted with brilliant technical aspects and production values. The film dares to be original and deliver something different rather than follow a tried and tested formula, and full kudos to Sandeep Reedy (Director & Producer) for attempting a new approach.

Definitely falls under ""The Cult"" category.\nThe boldest director Sandeep Vanga Reddy takes us through the journey of a Son's possessiveness towards his Dad to the volcanic extreme, that he is just replacing love with vengeance, peace with war, gentleness with rage and saneness with madness.\nMost of the scenes are original and never seen before.\nRanbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.\nThis marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.\nHaving to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.\nAnil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.\nBobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).\nTripti Dimra as Bhabi 2 was remarkable, I guess she was better than Rashmika.

When injustice is a new, people are supposed to be more angry, less accepting of it. Katniss was appropriately angry and defiant, whereas Lucy Gray was immediately giddy (i guess we are meant to interpret it as hippie freespirit i-love-all-peoples charm), and flirting with an agent of the state that has literally reaped her into an arena to kill her. Think of how much it would take to justify why a Jewish girl might even consider thinking of an SS soldier in a romantic light, and how little this story did to that end. The trust and romance between two characters from opposing sides of a fascist occupation has to OVERCOME that very tall barrier to earn any Rebel's trust. However even though the fact that Snow is doing it for personal gain was established, it was kind of ignored to continue this bizzare unearned romance.\nI am also okay with the premise that not every person in a fascist system is born evil, and showing the descent of a regular citizen into this kind of evil. However, living and participating every day in a fascist state has to impact your soul that ends up showing in small ways, casual dehuminisation of the Panem citizens, growing paranoia as the bombs start, disdain for the rebels etc. Which other characters in the academy and Grandma Snow does. But exceptionally, Snow was shown to be upstanding and moral throughout the movie except in the end with a abrupt descent into betraying his friend, all the while romancing a Panem citizen outside the district borders. It was so forced, and why?? We already knew that Snow would become evil, so why not show us how it happened in a believable manner (maybe show that his time as a peacekeeper interacting with D12 citizens allowed him to dehumanize them or something..), instead of rushing it as a ""twist"" at the very end of a very long movie?

There are definitely some intense scenes and some good acting that made me pay attention a couple of times but I can pinpoint another major problem going on here. The main character of Lucy comes across as way too helpless/defenseless in too many scenes and relies way too much on luck or someone to save her to get her out of danger.

So I think one big missed opportunity is with the plot around the Mentor Program and Corio Snow. Something that has always stuck with me are the servant master relationships we hear about during the American Slavery period. Famously, Thomas Jefferson had a very romantic time with one of his slaves. There should have been more about Lucy Gray, what does she really feel, does she feel grateful? Do they really fall in love or is she playing him? Yes there is that in the beginning but the movie never has the guts to say, these people are in a deep love for each other even though its a sick relationship with an extreme power imbalance. Perhaps they could show her having the power over a foolish Snow. She gets him to rig the games for her and yet has a soft spot for him by the end. Snow could be scandalized by being shown addicted to his ""lesser human"" girlfriend and therefore his cheating allegations and exile would impact him because he would be deeply grieving feeling that he would never see Lucy again. Lots of ways they could go with this.\nAlso there is just not enough done with the 1960s TV premise. What if this was the first Games in Color? People in The Capital would see the red blood of kids for the first time, would that make a difference on how Panem sees the kids? So many characters could bring you a deep feeling through their eyes of seeing all this awful trauma.\nHow Snow relates to the people on District 12 how it made him change The Hunger Games in how he did how it made him see the people of Panem as human beings and yet how he rationalized seeing himself as worthy of dominating and controlling them at the end, is stuff that can take the viewers on a ride of terror and imagination.\nThe premise, theme, storyline and dialogues of this movie in the right hands are Oscar winning. Too bad they failed on most execution. Another movie that could be life changing wasted in the Hollywood machine.

6595b4d4a783f0cdafc9ac5f,tt0095016,Die Hard,a_chinn,28 December 2023,9,"A friend rented out a theater the week before Christmas for a big screen viewing of this holiday classic (I dressed up like a minor character Uli) and it was fantastic to get to see this on the big screen once again and with an audience, which I hadn't experienced since high school when I saw it in the theater with my dad back when the movie first came out. The crowd was filled with quite a few twenty-somethings who'd never seen the film before (which seems unbelievable to this old Gen-Xer) but that made it even more fun to experience the film with an audience laughing and reacting to all the right parts in this almost 40-year-old movie! Everyone laughed at Theo and Karl betting in the background whether Mr. Takagi could give up the computer passcode or when Asian terrorist Uli takes a candy bar out of the display case. You could feel the audience squirm as John McClane pulled glass out of his feet. They laughed at all the right parts and cheered at all the right moments. It reminded me of how movies are best enjoyed as a communal experience. When DIE HARD first came out, everyone rolled their eyes at Bruce Willis being an action hero. Up until that point, action heroes were musclebound unstoppable he-men along the lines of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Sure there were some non-musclebound ones too, like Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford, but they were certainly not comedians, which is what Bruce Willis was primarily known for at this time. Before DIE HARD, he was really only known for the hit TV series MOONLIGHTING (if you haven't seen it, it's on Hulu right now) and one Blake Edwards comedy (which wasn't a box office hit). The studio originally offered the part of McClane to Stallone and Schwarzenegger, but the film is a classic because of Willis. He made McClane a vulnerable character, who does get hurt and who could be killed. Willis eventually became an unstoppable action hero like Sly and Arnold, which may be lost on audiences watching this film for the first time now, but back then, Willis was just that goofy guy from TV trying the best he could to save people from bad guys.\nBut I haven't said anything about DIE HARD itself. Everyone knows the story, so I won't summarize it here, but if you somehow have never seen it before, stop what you're doing right now and watch it! Bruce Willis is effortlessly funny, vulnerable, and heroic all at the same time, which is a nice contrast to most action heroes of the 80s who would only wisecrack one-liners and would never dare to be self-deprecating. Though as great as Willis is, Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in as lead bad guy Hans Gruber. He gets some great lines and character touches from the script, like complimenting Mr. Takagi on his suit or when he pretends to be a hostage, but it's Rickman's refined air that elevates the film. The class Rickman brings to his character is a fun contrast to Willis' blue-collar hero. And what a killer supporting cast, that includes Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt. Al Powell, Paul Gleason playing another jerk, this time the clueless Deputy Police Commissioner, William Atherton as a nasty TV reporter, Hart Bochner as a coke-snorting executive, Alexander Gudunov as terrorist Karl, the great Al Leong (you've seen him in just about every iconic 80s action film), Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as Agents Johnson and Johnson, and De'voreaux White as Argyle, who I don't remember from anything else, but who was apparently in THE BLUES BROTHERS and TRESPASS when I looked him up on IMDB. DIE HARD is a a witty and clever script from Steven E. De Souza and Jeb Stuart, who both mostly write passable dreck unless their films were made by solid directors like Walter Hill (48HRS), Andrew Davis (THE FUGITIVE), or John McTiernan here with DIE HARD, so I'm giving McTiernan credit to making this film what it is. Credit also has to go to ace cinematographer Jan de Bont, who shot such classics as BLACK RAIN, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and BASIC INSTINCT, and would later go on to direct himself, with SPEED being his one standout film. Top it all off with a memorable score by 80s mainstay composter Michael Kaman (LETHAL WEAPON, THE DEAD ZONE, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, HIGHLANDER, BRAZIL, etc.) and you have the makings for a classic. Overall, DIE HARD is an absolute 80s action classic, and yes, DIE HARD is a Christmas movie!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

It definitely wasn't the flawless movie that everyone makes it out to be.\nAlan Rickman as Hans grubber Is a phenomenal preformance and deserves to go down as one of the best villian preformance.

It's everything you want in a Summer action flick even though Die Hard gets the debate that it's actually a Christmas film. Make no mistake this is not a Christmas film but an action film set during Christmas. There should be no debate on this but every Christmas it comes up. Die Hard was the launching pad for making Bruce Willis the action star that he became. In fact I miss action films like this that had plenty of action scenes and explosions that were practical. In todays World we get plenty of CGI fight scenes and over the top action.

6595b4d4a783f0cdafc9ac63,tt0095016,Die Hard,pete-murphy97,25 December 2023,8,"""Die Hard"" is perhaps the quintessential action film for the Christmas season. Where most Christmas films had opted for the predictably warm and fuzzy, and still often do; director John McTiernan had introduced a landmark infusion of action to the monotone Christmas genre, whilst still managing to keep the Christmas spirit well intact, in its own way. It's become a household classic ever since and conveys the importance of fighting against all odds, even when others doubt you. And that situations are felt most clearly by those with their feet firmly planted on the ground; John McClane's barefooted ordeals reflect this message. It's a celebration of the streetwise and the grounded underdog.\nBruce Willis's breakout role as the irreverent and muscled NYPD copper John McClane was eminently career-defining, and quite possibly one of the most strikingly masculine chainsmoking protagonists of film history. A triangle of witty repartees between McClane, Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), and Alan Rickman's flamboyant classically-educated West German villain, Hans Gruber, creates both tension and levity at the film's close-quarters setting, Nakatomi Plaza; as a high-octane game of cat-and-mouse unfolds. You'll also be graced by one of the most iconic one-liner catchphrases; ""Yippee-ki-yay..."" part of cinema lore's lexicon, and for which no caption is needed for further explanation. However a reviewer at the time of release had backhandedly suggested it as a ""nearly perfect movie for our time"", yet designed to appeal to audiences they'd described as ""kidults""-adults with the mindset of children. Nonetheless, McTiernan masterfully combines brains, heart, and brawn in thrillingly explosive action sequences and soulful character development whilst not granting any character the privileges of infallibility or invulnerability. The film combines three subplots to form the overall plot meaning there's plenty going on at any one time and a lot of reasons to stay invested in this film for its full runtime, and to prompt repeat viewings. Deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017. An all-round blast.\n8.1/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

The beginning was a bit shaky and had the audience rightfully confused for the first hour or so, just waiting anxiously for answers, but the answers themselves more than made up for all of it. And don't get me wrong: being confused doesn't equal couldn't enjoy. I still found the beginning fun to watch, but I liked it a lot more when things started to piece together. What really brought me in was the dynamic between Vardha and Deva, which I won't talk too much about to avoid spoiling anything. From the eyes of someone who absolutely loved KGF 1 & 2, I say this movie wasn't a disappointment in the slightest. At the very least, it has me looking forward to the next part. The acting, story, and characters made this a great watch. Definitely one of the best movies made in 2023, despite it's rocky start.\nIn summary, if you love action-packed movies that feature loyalty in its realest sense and have a main character that's easy to adore, a movie that's filled with emotion and suspense, a movie that's close to three hours yet has you wanting more at the end, Salaar might just fit your description. Again, I'm not too picky about my entertainment, but I can tell when a movie's not good, and judging by this review, you already know what I think of Salaar P1 (it's been a while since I've seen a movie that had me this drawn in).

The lack of diversity in this aspect mars an otherwise outstanding plot.

The story is simply about a family, and a father that hides his dark, bloody past. When things are getting out of control for him, he has to take the mission in his own hands and hide his true identity from his family. First, I had an impression that this was going to be a fun comedy that can live on its action, but turned out to be an unoriginal flick that really looks like it's written be Ai. First I got to mention the characters. I remembered maybe half of the names, because I never get connected that much (Besides the father, Sean, the main hero) that by the way carried the cast mostly. Sean as a character himself was interesting, but unfortunately not so interesting as I expected him to be. The villain he had to fight came out of nowhere and felt totally out of place, in my opinion. His backstory came more on the end, too, and I wished maybe a little peak before. Sean's wife (The Mother) was fun, yet she was very plastic and the actress could be more of a food commercial women. The kids are the most predictable characters, easily comparable to kids from other family comedies. It's always a computer dude, a weirdo and some little kid. A few of the action sequences were acceptable, yet not so great as I expected. Generic and predictable, it tried to make things interesting but ended with a cheesy cliché that should never took have place. I got really surprised over the camera filming and overall quality, and sometimes I think that not only Apple sponsored this movie, but helped to make it with their cameras. I don't know if I liked it or not, it was a weird feeling in the filming, I don't know, something was just strange. The movie was carried by nice soundtrack, as well as nice suspense score that was good, but some of the action was so lame that the music was wasted for nothing, and that's bad, because they could use it for something much better. In the end, this is an Ai-Script, bad, plastic acting, as well as uninteresting and forgettable action. The rating was saved some more by a few good sequences and nice soundtrack overall.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,

For a budget that looks incredibly budgeted and small compared to Hollywood's recent $200-300 Million bloated budgets and limitations of practical and visual effects, this movie absolutely blows the competition out of the water.\nToho made the right choice to go back to basics and make Godzilla the ultimate destructive antagonistic force of nature and bringing back the monster-horror aspect that's very much needed in these movies.\nLike the 1954 original, the dark and serious tone works beautifully and incredibly effectively in conveying what the scene needs to. And whether on screen, off screen or implied, Godzilla's mere presence conveys that tone of dread and terror, truly retaining back the title of King of the Monsters.\nAnd the characters! It's been a long time since we've had characters in these films that we could actually care for, let alone give any interest or sympathy towards. Minus One's characters grow and are fleshed out throughout the story, and the context of being a kamakazi pilot in a post-WWII 1940's Japan. It asks questions of the value of life and vengeance for those who've lost theirs, and the guilt of actions, what we do and don't do. This film reflects back to a conflicted and broken time, but one inhabited by good and united people choosing to give their lives for something greater. It's truly a relieving and hopeful sight for what makes great cinema through the infinite muddled assembly line of cheap, poorly made, factory-produced content called film.\nForget the multiverse movies, give us more of this!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,

Like 2019's Joker, it feels like a movie that is much greater than its genre, using the Godzilla skin as a vessel to tell a bigger story.\nGodzilla Minus One is set in Japan at the end of World War II. We meet Shikishima, a Kamikaze pilot who survived the war but for several reasons believes he has failed as a man and as a representative of the Japanese Army.\nDuring this time, Godzilla appears and we follow the Army's attempt to stop Godzilla. These two plot lines intertwine and complement each other throughout the film as we are given a window into the Japanese war mentality.\nThe scenes with Godzilla are epic. It's the best and most menacing I've ever seen Godzilla look. Unlike in recent films, Godzilla feels majestic and absolutely terrifying. The Godzilla laser beam was crafted amazingly. Each laser beam felt as big a deal as the explosion scene in Oppenheimer.\nI had heard good things but this generally surprised me. I was captivated throughout.

This compelling story about human beings faced by existential crisis is so touching.\nThis drama is set in post-war Japan, when Japan tried to recover from the damage caused by war and re-establish a new society. One of the highlights for the film is the evocative human drama which plays a significant role in this film. Firstly, the plot delves into the sense of guilt and search for redemption of the protagonist, Koichi Shikishima, an ex-Kamikaze pilot. By using its machine's fault as pretext, he fails to complete a mission as the pilot. Throughout the film, we see him grappling with the consequences of his actions, sense of loss and shame. Shikishima won't stop his ongoing search for redemption while he can't even allow himself to embrace life itself. The dishonour shames and haunts him as he waits for an opportunity for living his life again. This failed war hero story is recounted poignantly and compellingly. The screen play by Yamazaki gives us hope for humanity as many of the citizens fight against the monster with their sense of moral purpose. This is a film about Godzilla; however, the balance between the 'human story' and the 'Godzilla spectacle' seems just right.\nRyonosuke Kamiki's acting was highly convincing and the timing of his line delivery is masterful. It could be also said Yamazaki's film craft made the screenplay more effective and alive. One of the memorable lines is 'my war hasn't finished yet' which Shikishima utters during an argument with a colleague at a local izakaya. The camaraderie and affection shown by his co-coworkers were also beautiful. Kuranoske Sasaki's acting highlights qualities of a fearless colleague who seems rather rough, but who cares about others and is ready to embrace this mission to conquer Godzilla.\nOf course the entertainment value of Godzilla cannot be missed. The scale of the spectacle and absurdity of Godzilla's relentlessness is sometimes comical, yet at times also moving. Music written by Naoki Sato sets scenes skilfully. It creates an ominous and foreboding mood while it enhances tragedy and tension of the film.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,

However, the caution in film making and storytelling today, together with the fact that most people now consider themselves hardcore critics first, rather than an audience, contributes to a scarcity of heartfelt and those charming imperfections in movies.\nThe things we loved about Indiana Jones: Indy clumsily beating up Nazis and creepy Indian cult members over some archaeological artifact. Accompanied by John Williams' brilliant melodies, occasionally a little bit too loud and tiresome score and dialogue but... Nevertheless, it remains a masterpiece-ingenious, entertaining, and delightfully imperfect.\nNo need to compare this final chapter to its predecessors.

The first three movies are bona-fide classics, built on great story telling, imaginative action scenes and extremely charming performances from Ford, and all the supporting casts. But this film has none of that. Ford looks great, but he can't hold the film together. Mads is terrific, but Waller-Bridge is no film star, and is extremely poor and charmless. I've watched the original movies countless times, even the much maligned 4th movie has its highlights (Blanchlet is superb), but I'll never watch this movie again.

But I did think that it would be reasonably entertaining and a decent end to the poorly named trilogy. But not so much. It's far too long and it sent me to sleep.\nThe problems are manifold I think. For one it's trying to be an action movie when the Indy films were always just comic books projected onto the big screen. Sure they have action but it's in the service of something else rather than being the main attraction.\nThen there's the fact that, keeping with the comic book style, previous scripts have been generally light-hearted and funny. An attempt is made here at humour but that's as far as it goes. In fact much of the dialogue between Indy and Helena (the other main character but not a love interest thank God!) is snarky and lacking in affection.\nFinally you've got a bizarre plot involving time travel, Nazis (what, again?) and the Greek empire. It's just all over the place with long sequences given over to CGI effects that look out of place.\nI hesitate to say that this could ever have been a good movie but you never know with Harrison Ford. There's a reason why he was (and is) a movie star and it comes down to his easy charisma and ability to light up a film. But even his talent is put to the test here.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,

He's still got it at 80+ years of age. The throw-back to create the story line was creative too. They did an awesome job of recreating those scenes from the Last Crusade.

In the original films the violence has an almost comic edge to it and it is largely confined to the 'baddies' getting their well served punishment. This film seems to revel in the body count of dead civilians. The chief villain is a poorly fleshed out character and his henchmen have no redeeming or comic qualities. They are just nasty pieces of work. The plot is confusing and frankly boring. And there are very few nice characters including Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character. Those that do raise a smile are not in the film long. The tone of this film is bleak and miserable, it has been made by old men about an old character and you can feel it in every frame. There isn't much humour in watching an old man at the end of his life. The budget was far too big and they've, frankly, chucked everything and the kitchen sink at it. The action scenes are too lunch and predictable and everything is drenched in CGI. The sound quality is awful.

It draws the viewer firmly into a world where AI Robots are as ubiquitous as mobile phones today and they are partly human with faces that reflect the diversity of the human species in both ethnicity and age. To some, this makes no sense as we're used to seeing Robots in sci-fi that all look the same, however if you accept the premise that these simulants are meant to blend into all aspects of human culture, it makes sense. It also adds more conviction that the simulants represent an entirely seperate species aside from humanity with their own diversity and complexity. Contrasting this are the utilitarian faceless robots that perform functions such as the police and army bots. I think it worked very well.\nThere's are aspects here which remind me of Blade Runner in terms of the city scapes and the infrastructure around this robotic world, but on the ground it reminds me of District 9 and Elysium to some degree, where technology is advanced but also used , scratched, dirty and worn. This conveys reality and is very likely what will happen when we eventually have robots everywhere.\nThe story is somewhat original and the acting is excellent, particularly John David Washington who is eminently watchable and the child robot, Alpha who is remarkable. I loved the fact that most of the cast were Asian, the languages and locations were Asian, and it was a refreshing change from always having these blockbusters set in the USA. It was also a metaphor for American interference in other parts of the world and the remote warfare which is today conducted by technology mostly and mostly happens in silence from western media. There is some deep commentary here on the morals and societal ignorance of stealth warfare, but it is delivered mostly visually, there for those who might wish to dwell on it if they like, rather than any outright political monologue that might seem preachy. This was smartly done.\nNot just Sci-Fi, it has heart and is a film for everyone.

One side of humanity seeks harmony between AI and humans; the other side fights to win the ""Humans versus AI"" conflict, believing that loss = extinction. It's like trying to choose between a digital utopia and an Armageddon nightmare. Gareth Edwards pulls it off with style.\nThe movie juxtaposes between these two contrasting worldviews using visually stunning ""uniforms."" One team is represented by ""Zen"" like New Asian ""harmony"" vibe that values all life; while the other team uses a military industrial complex motif, dark corridors, heartless soldiers. At the same time, you have a group of researchers attempting to create/raise an electronic savior figure that will rescue the oppressed AI - a futuristic ""Moses.""

(It has to be...right?!? I mean look at the price!) The scenes are a visual feast, and you find yourself forgiving any budget constraints because the cinematography is on point.\nThe special effects - they're downright incredible. Every frame is a testament to Edwards' visual genius.

It's a simple premise about anthropomorphic ducks - the father duck, Mack (Nanjiani), wants to protect his children/chicks, Dax (Jennings) and Gwen (Gazal), and the mother duck, Pam (Banks), wants them to experience the world and gain some experience. They meet some other ducks migrating south for the winter - they're presumably in North-Eastern USA - so they decide to do the same, with quirky uncle Dan (DeVito) in tow.\nWhat follows is both a semi-familiar road-trip comedy, as well as a refreshing take on family, trying new things and helping others. There's a great support cast, as the duck family passes through New York City and meets Chump the pigeon (Awkwafina), Delroy the macaw (Key), as well as Erin the heron (Kane) and GooGoo (Mitchell) - either a goose or a white duck. There's a nice jail-break sequence for Delroy, which sets up the human antagonist, the Chef.\nFor some reason the Chef also has a Chinook and hunts them down, leading to Dax and Gwen having to step-up. The animation is a nice mix of cartoonish and realistic, and it looks excellent, especially at the end. There's no overly-scary moments, some teachable themes, the voice cast is all good and there's consistent laughs throughout.

Movie being the second-highest grossing film of 2023. However, true respect and acclaim still elude the Minion-spawning animation house. Migration, a film about a family of ducks, the Mallards, led by Kumail Nanjiani and Elizabeth Banks, aims to break the labels of cheap gags and stories that appeal to a broad audience. The creative control of Ernest and Celestine co-director Benjamin Renner promises a different approach to other Illumination movies. Migration's success can be attributed to its focus on relationships and warmth, which has been absent from much of Illumination's output since the first Despicable Me. The Mallard family's journey to Jamaica is a well-crafted film that builds connections between its ducklings, enhancing the plot. The family's motivations for leaving their pond and their desire for adventure are relatable, as is the family's patriarch, Mack, who prioritizes the safety of his children over everything else. When the family faces the challenge of survival in New York City, their perception of the world is challenged. Despite being set up as a stereotypical family with a stern dad, loving mom, and a brash teenage boy with a cute younger sister, the film ensures an emotional attachment to the ducklings, making it a satisfying and formulaic film. The animation quality in Migration represents an evolution of Illumination's past work. The film begins with a beautifully rendered bedtime story, blending hand-drawn and CG elements. The CG journey is characterized by realism, with cliffs tanned with autumn leaves and New York cityscapes painted with concrete coldness and bustling life. The water animation and cloud effects are particularly impressive. These changes do not change Illumination's identity, but rather create a better version of the typical film. However, this overfamiliarity overshadows much of Migration's cool new elements. Migration, a 3D animation by Mike White, is a delightful story developed with French animation director Benjamin Renner. Renner, known for his 2012 2D film Ernest and Celestine, has joined Illumination to lead his first studio and 3D animation effort, which is sure to delight fans of ducks. The Mallard family lives a dependable life in a pond, with dad Mack (Kumail Nanjiani) hesitant to leave his accustomed life. Wife Pam (Elizabeth Banks) encourages him to relax and take their children, Dax (Caspar Jennings) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal), on a trip to Jamaica. After a heart-to-heart with Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito), Mack realizes he has been missing life's essence and agrees to take the family on a life-changing adventure.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,

What looked like a painfully average Illumination movie turned out to be one of its best! We got a well-written family story from Mike White about getting out of one's comfort zone and accepting change with likeable characters, solid humour, and beautiful visuals. It even had some good tension and suspense! Migration isn't your usual fare from Illumination, in fact, it might very well be the antithesis to the claims people (including me) make about Illumination. There are no pop culture references. The humour is character, visual, or slapstick based (I actually laughed a lot) and the characters are really lovable. It's very sweet and the animation is stunning and extremely expressive. The visuals are really stellar - a massive step up for Illumination. It's easily their best animation. The musical score was fantastic too - John Powell did not have to go that hard with his score. The music is so fun and inventive. And the voice cast turned out to be really awesome! Migration is a wholesome, charming film for the whole family that is very funny and has a lot of heart. Went in expecting a dumb, pop culture romp and got a funny, sweet, entertaining, and gorgeously animated family adventure.

What initially seems like a sardonic anti-Christmas movie soon reveals itself to be genuinely interested in spreading Yuletide cheer, although that's not to imply it doesn't also feature all the brutality, bad language and bodily fluids its concept promises. Merging 'Die Hard (1988)', 'Home Alone (1990', 'Bad Santa (2004)' and 'John Wick (2014)' (or, perhaps more accurately, some of its lesser imitators), the piece provides a stockingful of festive fun despite its undeniably derivative nature. David Harbour and John Leguizamo make up for the cast's general lack of charisma, as they're eminently watchable and sell even the silliest of dialogue. Though the piece is certainly self-aware, it's also really sincere and it establishes a strong sense of character for its central figure. In fact, Papa Noël actually has a relatively convincing character arc which prevents his inclusion from feeling as half-baked as it may initially seem. Although the flick sometimes comes closer to feeling like 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009)' than 'Die Hard (1988)' (particularly when it comes to most elements not directly associated with Santa), it features plenty of well-choreographed and exciting set-pieces that revel in all the gory mayhem you could want. The action never rises to the level of something like 'John Wick (2014)', but it's better than a lot of similar American stuff and it continues the welcome post-'Wick' trend of having clean camera work that favours wider compositions. The movie is really fun when it gets going. It has a few issues here and there, and it's arguably a little too sappy for its own good, but it's an entertaining actioner with a strong central performance and several accomplished set-pieces.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

What I like to do most during the holiday period is watching at least one - preferably more - Christmas horror movies, but the two mainstream non-horror Christmas movies that I've seen the most (that everyone has seen the most, for that matter) are ""Die Hard"" and ""Home Alone"".\n""Violent Night"" may not be a genuine horror movie, but it's excessively violent for sure, and - moreover - it's a love letter to the two aforementioned cinematic Christmas landmarks! Tommy Wirkola, who brought us the refreshing ""Dead Snow"", goes mainstream with this thrill-ride of an actioner about Santa Clause - the real one - battling a small army of evil scoundrels and protecting a cute girl and her rotten wealthy family during a heist/home invasion. It's not very original, it's not particularly sophisticated, but it sure is a lot of fun.\nCertain ideas and gimmicks in the script are genius, like Santa having a Viking background, the casting of Beverly D'Angelo as a loathsome hag of a matriarch, or the killing of thugs with Christmas attributes like candy canes or electric lights. Other parts are clichéd and/or sentimental (but mandatory), like the overlong ""true meaning of Christmas"" conversations, but that's just a minor default. The ""John Wick"" type of battle in the bar is déjà-vu but nonetheless exciting, especially because it's to the cheesy tones of Bryan Adams' ""Christmas Time"".

I'll be honest, this movie made me feel everything: sadness, excitement, anticipation, anxiety. I literally cried, laughed, was on the edge of my seat, and cheered. All of that without dialogue. Personally, I was impressed and indeed, I am surprised by all the negative reviews.\nI love the John Wick movies, and I think one mistake is this film being associated with that series. They're not even in the same league, but in a good way. One of the things I appreciated most was how realistic most of the training/revenge was. Yes, I know, some things were still questionable... but it felt possible overall.\nNothing can please everyone, but I had to add my own take on it. I hope it is viewed by the people who will appreciate what was done with this film. I will definitely be watching it again. Loved it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

Mind you, they haven't got a good track record as it is as many of their films are total flops and are literally ""made for TV"" films that just shows the calibre.

Directed by the action, Master John Woo who spent nearly 20 years making historical drama films in China returns to the genre that put him on the map in the first place. Nobody can dispute the peerless action drama of the likes of hard boiled, hard target and face off. But those were all long time ago.\nI don't know why he decided to make another American movie after such a long hiatus, but he is back with an intriguing idea of doing a film with no dialogue at all. There are a few moments of showing newspaper cuttings or texts to add a little bit of flavour, but he wanted to come up with an idea of explaining an entire story with no dialogue, and it works. The idea of a bereaved father going for revenge and slowly coming up with his plan is really intriguing and Woo does it extremely well. Let's be honest a lot of action dialogue is really there to set up the conflict and is often criticised for being cheesy.\nThe problem is after an opening action scene when there is nothing except seeing the father train there isn't enough in this film. It could've really of done with a big action sequence in the middle to reassure you. With no funny dialogue no plot twist you've seen all of this done before in a more entertaining way and without the dialogue no matter how well done it is it is, I'm sorry to say, a bit dull. When the action comes, it's good, but it isn't peak Woo.\nIt turns out there's a reason why we have dialogue in movies after all.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

Tom Cruise carries the movie most of the way through but you could near say with a bunch of cliche scenes that were a throw back from the first movie.\nI could say that the movie felt slapped together more for a cash grab rather than put together a great follow up script from part 1.\nIt was the usual script where they throw the manual out the window and let's do it the way that would get 99% thrown out of a training school whether it be a teacher or student but it's ok for Maverick to work right outside the laws that everyone else is given and get away with it with no action taken.\nI liked two scenes in it and one was when Tom was initially in the bar and saw his ex wingman's son playing the piano and the scene where he met up with Val Kilmer. The rest was predictable and nothing new added to the story from part 1.\nIt was good but I really felt it was more of a let's run the 2nd movie to grab some extra cash rather than bringing anything new to make it more intriguing.

Technically its spectacular the sound design conveying the awesome speed and power of aviation, the cinematography and cockpit footage is second to none and leaves you baffled how they achieved it. The new group of characters are memorable and the film does a good job at developing them and their stories while also allowing Tom Cruise to still shine in the lead role. The film has some nice call backs to the original but it's more just a just a repeat of the first movie. The film is pretty fresh these days in being very unapologetic and patriotic in it's themes and imagery. While it's a pretty great film there's a few moments where it tries a bit too hard to pay homage to the original, it also had me think it pushed things a bit too far towards the end that I didn't quite believe it.

About the mission we only got to know the trajectory of the planes and their job but there was no backstory.\nThe main plot, between Mav and Rooster was consistent and the two actors had interesting chemistry. On the other hand, the love story felt rushed and the female character felt like a prop. The love story, although secondary, isn't supposed to feel like a box checked from the Hollywood movie guidelines but the lack of depth, kind of made it look like that.\nFinally, all the actors used too much makeup it really through me off. Between that and the fake tan, they definitely didn't look like they were on the job as pilots in the navy. Felt staged and amateur, a classic Hollywood mistake though.\nThe effect are now much better than in the first one, but that's just a consequence of the evolution of technology, yet it made the movie makers lazy, they relied on the great visuals.

While the film brings back the familiar thrill of high-speed aviation, it introduces a new dimension to the narrative by keeping the enemy shrouded in mystery. This choice to not define the antagonist is more of a subtle nuance than a central theme, offering a fresh perspective on conflict depiction.\nPrimarily, the film serves as a homage to the original 1990's ""Top Gun,"" targeting an audience who grew up with the first installment. It's a celebration of the past, aimed at fans who have aged alongside the movie's hero, portrayed once again by Tom Cruise. However, for those who didn't experience the first film, ""Maverick"" might feel like a relic of a bygone era, echoing a time when such stories were in their prime.\nThe charm of ""Top Gun: Maverick"" lies in its ability to transport viewers back to the days of the original film, yet it also struggles to fully engage those seeking a contemporary action experience. The movie walks a fine line between honoring its roots and adapting to modern filmmaking standards.\nIn essence, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a journey through time, revisiting iconic characters in a world that has evolved yet remains anchored in its origins. It's a film that nostalgically recalls the glory of its predecessor while navigating new skies, offering a ride that is enjoyable but may not resonate with everyone.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,,,,,

Joaquin Phoenix seems miscast or perhaps the screenplay makes him play the character on one note: morose, surly, un-charismatic. He was much more compelling as the tyrannical Roman emperor Commodus in ""Gladiator"", also directed by Scott. As Josephine, Vanessa Kirby only appears in some brief scenes and their relationship isn't very passionate.\nThere are some blatant historical errors: Napoleon wasn't present at the execution of Marie-Antoinette, Robespierre was guillotined not (as in the film, I think) beaten to death, Napoleon has an imaginary meeting before the Battle of Waterloo and, most blatantly, he wasn't born in February 1768 as he states, but on 15 August 1769. In fact, 1768 - though in May - was the year when his native Corsica officially became French.\nThe battle scenes are certainly spectacular, and superbly choreographed. However, their choreography perhaps makes them look too elegant, not drenched in blood and gore (maybe my attention wandered). The choreography is excellent in the Court scenes, with beautiful dances - making an ironic contrast with the battles. Those are the only scenes in the film that I really enjoyed.\nUnderstandably, it's impossible even to condense Napoleon's biography in 2½ hours. We see nothing for instance about the Napoleonic Code, which had a far-reaching influence on civil law, or his pioneering, and perhaps grandiose, town planning projects.

I am not even talking about historical inaccuracies like failing to heed Napoleon's young age (23) when he recaptured Toulon (Joaquin looks well in his 40s, too old for the part from the outset); the fact that in reality Josephine was older than Bonaparte, though Vanessa Kirby looks young and wearing a sexily short hairstyle probably caused by her time in the clink, otherwise completely out of tune with late 19th Century women's hairstyles and wigs); the unpardonable failure to mention the importance of Rouget de Lille's national anthem, and how Napoleon used it repeatedly to arouse his troops' nationalistic fervor and preserve their loyalty; or the fact that Napoleon ordered his troops to live off the land by plundering property, raping, and killing civilians, with the booty then transferred to France; Napoleon's famously enigmatic call ""Soldiers! From atop these pyramids 40 centuries look down on you"" is ignored, which is a pity because it leaves out Napoleon's extensive general knowledge, ability to convey ideas in stylistic phrases, his knowledge of his soldiers, down to privates whose children's names he carefully memorized, and the fact that he was an avid reader of all manner of books, notably the classics.\nInstead, Napoleon is depicted by Ridley Scott as a power-driven, callous military leader who engaged in rambunctious sex with Josephine, and cared for little else. His early years in his birthplace Ajaccio, Corsica, to which he returned from the military academy in mainland France with plans of ruling, along with his numerous brothers and relatives, but from where he was ousted in embarrassing defeat by local ruler Paoli, and never returned to the island; his heavy island accent that his classmates at the military academy ridiculed and which reportedly only increased his determination to outshine them; the fact that mother Letitia and brother Lucien just appear and disappear, no mention is made of brother Joseph to whom he entrusted the throne of Spain, all such omissions make Scott's Napoleon a carboard cutout of a character.\nTo compound matters, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a bafflingly wooden performance that gives Napoleon the vocal intonations of a 21st Century American when he opens his mouth, about as out of place as the multivaried, noisy, meaningless soundtrack.\nThe film also expects the viewer to know history, a very high demand indeed. For instance, it mentions the Prussians in the Battle of Waterloo but fails to explain that Prussia is today the eastern part of Germany. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge just how fast Napoleon moved his troops for surprise attacks in far flung parts of Europe, which Napoleon saw as a unit - prompting many historians to credit Napoleon as the seed-planter for today's European Union.\nThe worst flaw is the mish-mash sountrack, with a song by Edith Piaf, what sounds like South American Indian chants (Napoleon never went near South America), some funereal music, some live beat, too modern, cacophony - all very annoying and disruptive.\nThe best is the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski, with the battle of Austerlitz as the cherry on the film's rather elephantine cake.\nI left the movie feeling that the Duke of Wellington really wiped the ground with Napoleon at Waterloo. In truth, it was a much closer battle than portrayed in the film and it was the Prussians who came to Wellington's rescue and prevented Napoleon fleeing under cover of night, with the USA as intended destination.\nFor a serious, knowlegeable analysis of the motivations, character, relations and other facets of the man Napoleon Bonaparte, do yourself a favor and see the documentary THE RISE AND FALL OF NAPOLEON: THE MAN WHO WOULD RULE EUROPE on Youtube.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,
6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9accb,tt13287846,Napoleon,nahunter-51111,30 December 2023,5,"Ridley Scott's latest historical masterpiece, ""Napoleon,"" initially promised a riveting exploration of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the iconic French emperor. However, the anticipation built on paper quickly dissolves into a rollercoaster of disappointment, echoing recent missteps in Scott's repertoire like ""The Last Duel"" and ""House of Gucci.""\nThe film's 2-hour and 38-minute runtime becomes an endurance test for the audience, provoking frequent watch-checking amid a narrative that unfolds at an agonizing pace. Attempting to encapsulate a multitude of events results in overwhelming frustration, suggesting that ""Napoleon"" might have thrived as an episodic miniseries, providing room for a more immersive historical exploration.\nHowever, amidst the film's pitfalls, there's a silver lining in its awe-inspiring battle scenes that demand a strong stomach. Vanessa Kirby steals the spotlight with a stellar performance, overshadowing the lackluster portrayal by Phoenix. Rumors swirl about Kirby's potential involvement in Marvel's Fantastic 4 film, hinting at her ascent to more significant roles.\nPhoenix's performance, though not devoid of merit, echoes shades of his Arthur character from ""Joker"" (2019), creating an incongruence with his mid-century Frenchman portrayal. Amidst a predominantly British-accented cast, Phoenix's portrayal leans towards laziness, emphasizing hyperbolic ""Napoleon"" tendencies rather than exploring deeper motivations.\nThe breakneck speed of the narrative allows little room for character depth, resulting in a biopic with thematic blandness. Despite a handful of remarkable battle scenes, ""Napoleon"" falters, adding another setback to Ridley Scott's otherwise distinguished filmography. The journey is tumultuous, but the cinematic odyssey of ""Napoleon"" will leave audiences questioning the choices made on and off the battlefield.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,

I went into this movie thinking it was going to be okay at best, but this movie was a pleasant surprise The story was quite fun to follow, if a little predictable at times. The characters weren't very deep, but decent enough. There was no character that made me want to rub my head into the couch anytime they spoke. The fact it was a glorified advertisement shown through a few times like all the times they say, ""It's not a game. It's a simulator."" That got on my nerves quite a bit. Besides that the racing was pretty decent. Some of the passes were way too easy, but it was nowhere near as bad as some than movies. It isn't Lightning McQueen cutting through 40 cars in a few laps then being stuck at the front for the rest of the race. I thought cars and races looked pretty cool and the failure montage was fun.

And their character tropes and archs were exhausted decades ago on children's cartoons. I think the ""bad guy"" (why does there have to be a bad guy in a racing movie?) literally belongs on a Captain Planet episode.\nThe acting is subpar at best.

It looks good, the story overall is ok, too. But it feels kind of... Empty? Pointless? I did not feel much of a challenge in Jann reaching his dream, even though, I'm pretty sure, it was not that easy. Since there is no challenge, and since we already know how things will end (thanks to marketing) - there is absolutely no tension, there are no real stakes, there is no... Excitement. Which is core of racing, is it not?\nI remember people complaining that anime ""Overtake!"" lacked excitement in its racing, which was a valid criticism, but, at the least, it had something besides that: character development. It was not perfect, but it was there. Gran Turismo lacks even that. Or at least, I have not noticed any development. Besides, maybe, Jack Salter starting to believe that gamer can become a racer, after all.\nThe original story is something that can inspire. That's what all the marketing was talking about: ""achieve your dream"". But achieving a dream is not easy. There are struggles involved there. Yes, they probably will not be as intense as being in literal war, but they will be there. A movie - is a great opportunity to dramatize those struggles, to make you feel the tension of going against the flow.\nThis movie fails at that.

Achieving some of the greatest animation put to film, every moment of this movie is masterfully crafted to give each character and universe its own unique look and feel. It truly is remarkable how much work went into this, but also unfortunate that it landed the animators in such a difficult work environment. While all of the voice acting is phenomenal, my biggest issue comes in with the characters. First, taking a joke villain like the Spot and turning him into a truly creepy and powerful foe is no small feat and I commend the writers for pulling that off. The issue comes with Spider-Man, all of them. Besides Miles Morales, every version of Spider-Man is perverse with the out of line ideals of the Spider Society. There are no versions of Spider-Man that would ever stand by those ideals and it is wild how every current mainstream Spidey has lost the meaning of what the character stands for. I won't stand on my soapbox for long, but that is an issue I hope gets rectified in future appearances.

Everything Everywhere All at Once quite capitalised on it last Oscars season, so it's no surprise that the latest Spider-Man animated feature, which used the same tricks first, but maybe in a slightly more shambolic manner, is upping the ante.\nWhat used to be more of an acid trip back in 2018, is now a coherently crazy experience amplified 1000 times. Bearing traces of heavy influence from cyberpunk anime genre, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one hell of a never ending whirlwind of flickering coloured specks and hard beats. Multiply it by a variety of cultural references, a dozen different graphic styles and several languages changing fluidly into one another - and you'll end up with an absolute bomb that will blow your mind, in all ways good and bad.\nVisually, this film is a masterpiece. At least in the ""we've never seen anything like it"" sense. Yep, it's innovative, and probably not as vertigo-inducing as the first part, despite a sickening amount of action. It still doesn't make it easy to follow what's going on, but somehow the film retains your engagement, so you just go with the flow. And that's probably the biggest achievement for something that's quite chaotic and sensory overstimulating.\nStill, it feels like by overloading our senses with anime-like extremes, Spider-Man bypasses our prefrontal cortex and goes directly to ""the TikTok brain"" that's easily captivated by shiny moving things. So we end up having zero complaints eating subpar dialogues, classic cheap tricks like driving tension by artificially induced miscommunication, or single-agenda characters that follow their prescribed paths without deviation natural to real human beings.\nI can't deny that it felt good watching this film. But I am left with a tingling concern that it wasn't due to the complexity of emotions or a wide gamut of thoughts that it made us experience, but simply because our brains produced lots of happy chemicals in response to this sensory DDoS attack. Which, technically, is an achievement akin to the discovery of LSD, profound in its influence on the world. But, as with any real world drug, it makes you wonder: can feelings alone be trusted when evaluating the whole experience?\nModern problems require modern solutions.

6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9acdc,tt9362722,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,khanbaliq2,28 December 2023,9,"I briefly reviewed Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) in one of my posts soon after it was released in theaters, and it seems to me that some people got the idea that I don't like this film. This is not the case. I went to see this film 2 or 3 times when it was playing in theaters. I own it on video. I even have the soundtrack. It's just that I like Incredibles 2 (2018), which was released in the same year, slightly more than Into The Spider-Verse, and I don't think that Into The Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man movie or the best superhero movie ever. I think that Spider-Man 2 (2004) is still the best Spider-Man movie ever. I would say that both Into The Spider-Verse and Incredibles 2 have replay value. This is something that I can't say about many films that got made in the last two or even three decades. When I watched Into The Spider-Verse for the first time, I felt that something is not quite right with it, although I already realized that it's a special film. Into The Spider-Verse features a number of inspired scenes, appealing and detailed animation, a rather epic story, some good characterization, and many neat details. Still, perhaps the only main character that appealed to me back then is Peter B. Parker because I could relate to this character in a few ways and because he knew what he was doing. Miles Morales, who's the main main character in the film, didn't appeal to me in any way. I didn't even know about Miles Morales before I watched the film. For most of the film, Miles plays the role of comedic relief, and only at the very end does he get to do anything heroic by himself. There's also the fact that Into The Spider-Verse is a very kinetic film, in which almost everything happens fast. Therefore, it has to be seen more than once in order for the viewer to understand and to notice everything that happens in it. So, not only was seeing Into The Spider-Verse for the first time a new and somewhat odd experience for me, I didn't really find any of the main characters truly appealing. However, seeing Across The Spider-Verse in a theater made me like Into The Spider-Verse even more than I already did. First of all, both Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy get more character development in Across The Spider-Verse, thus turning them into more appealing characters. Second of all, many people (especially young men) have already been expressing their sweet hard love for Across The Spider-Verse, and especially for Gwen Stacy, on the internet. A few of them have been calling Across The Spider-Verse the best thing ever. Good for you, guys. But I don't share your euphoria. Perhaps it's because I'm a little more knowledgeable. Therefore, my reviews don't come down to phrases like ""Best movie ever!"" or ""F*ck this movie!"". Third of all, the animation style of Across The Spider-Verse is somewhat different from the animation style of Into The Spider-Verse. In some scenes, the animation of Into The Spider-Verse is almost photorealistic. But the animation of Across The Spider-Verse is often almost impressionistic. Both films feature some beautiful and detailed backgrounds. Fourth of all, I wouldn't go so far as to say that Across The Spider-Verse is a better film than Into The Spider-Verse. I think that they're equally impressive, though Across The Spider-Verse is perhaps a more exciting film. Fifth of all, all of the people in the auditorium where I got to see this animated film were adults. Most of them were in their late-twenties, thirties, or early-fourties. Some of them were old people. All of them were enjoying seeing the film a lot. What is going on here? I had a similar peculiar experience when I watched Titanic (1997) in a theater in February of this year. Most of the people in the auditorium were women, mostly young women, and some of them were truly excited and were even crying by the time the film came to an end. When the credits began to roll, these members of the fair sex all began to talk excitedly about the film. All I can say is that James Cameron knows how to make films that appeal to both men and women. No wonder his films bring in so much cash. Sixth of all, seeing Across The Spider-Verse later made me spend half a day on watching Into The Spider-Verse again on video. I watched some scenes several times, and I often paused the movie in order to look at the backgrounds and the character designs. It's true that Gwen Stacy sometimes moves like a ballet dancer in this film too. Before watching Across The Spider-Verse, I barely knew anything about Phil Lord and Christopher Miller because I had no interest in what these filmmakers have done. But, after taking a look at their filmography, it turned out that they worked on several films that I like quite a lot, and I got to see most of their films in theaters.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,

However, the film is very engaging and enjoyable all throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes runtime where it explores many characters and their developments without making the pace slow and boring. The movie was also filled with suprises from cameos to shocking plot twists. It was also really funny especially that they knew exactly where to include jokes. Additionally, the action scenes were so cool keeping the audience attached even more while watching.\nThe film is just visually stunning; from the comic style animation, to the background, to the colors, to the textures, its just all so appealing.

The film skillfully captures the stark societal contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the destitution in the Districts, creating a compelling visual landscape.\nThe movie successfully balances action with emotional resonance, exploring complex themes such as power dynamics and survival strategies. James Newton Howard's musical score enhances the cinematic experience, adding emotional weight to key moments.\nThe pace keeps you hooked, and the characters are so relatable. Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson kill it in their roles. Plus, the friendships and alliances in the Hunger Games add so much depth.\nLet's talk character relationships - it's not just about Katniss being a badass.

6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ace4,tt1392170,The Hunger Games,JamesHitchcock,22 December 2023,7,"At the centre of ""The Hunger Games"" is an idea also found in other movies such as ""Rollerball"" and ""The Running Man"", namely that of an authoritarian government using violent entertainment as a means of distracting the attention of the populace away from its misdeeds. It is an idea that probably derives from memories of classics lessons at school and that quip from Juvenal's satires about Roman emperors providing their subjects with ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses), although it is not one that has been generally borne out by modern totalitarian states.\nThe film is set at some time in the distant future in the Republic of Panem, a state situated somewhere in what is today the USA. (The name of the country is an obvious reference to Juvenal's quip quoted above). The Hunger Games of the title is an annual event which commemorates an unsuccessful rebellion 74 years earlier against the country's central government. Each of the twelve districts which participated in the revolt is compelled to send two teenagers, one male and one female, to the nation's capital. These young people, known as ""tributes"", are forced to fight to the death in an arena. The event, televised for the entertainment of the people of Panem, and is hugely popular; those who regard the idea as unutterably cruel are afraid to voice their opposition publicly as the despotic government does not take kindly to any criticism.\nThe main character is Katniss Everdeen, a working-class girl living in the impoverished District 12, an area of small farmers and coal miners. (Despite modern concerns about fossil fuels and global warming, it would seem that coal mining is still a major industry in Panem). When Katniss's younger sister Primrose is selected as one of District 12's tributes, Katniss selflessly volunteers to take her place. The film then follows what happens to Katniss when she travels to the capital, and the complications which arise when she falls in love with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from her district. (That's how the name is spelt in the cast list, although when watching the film I assumed he was called ""Peter"").\nBoth the original ""Rollerball"" from 1975 and ""The Running Man"" from 1987 were made before the current vogue for ""reality"" television. (I put that word in inverted commas because ""reality"" shows are one of the most phoney and unreal things on the box. Much more unreal than good honest fiction). They can, however, be seen as prescient in the way they seemed to predict it, especially ""The Running Man"". ""The Hunger Games"" was made after the ""reality"" revolution, and the satire against this genre is quite obvious. ""Reality"" shows might not involve ritualised killing, and for the most part they do not involve physical violence, but they often involve verbal violence and public humiliation, and pander to milder versions of the sadism and voyeurism which motivate the spectators seen in the film.\nIn my view ""The Hunger Games"" is better than either the original ""Rollerball"" or ""The Running Man"", and far better than the dismal ""Rollerball"" remake from 2002. (About which the less said the better). ""Rollerball"" is OK as an action movie about a violent sport, but works less well as a political satire, which was its main raison d'etre. ""The Running Man"" falls into the trap of becoming the thing it is satirising; the film is supposed to be a satire on violent and exploitative entertainment, but ends up becoming violent and exploitative entertainment itself. The main characters of both films, Jonathan E in ""Rollerball"" and Ben Richards in ""The Running Man"", are little more than ciphers who exist because the film needs a hero in order to make its point.\n""The Hunger Games"", by contrast, gives us two well-rounded characters in Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, characters who are more than just ciphers and with whom we can sympathise and identify. There is also a good performance from Donald Sutherland as Coriolanus Snow, the cynical and autocratic President of Panem. (To stress the link with the Roman Empire, most of Panem's social elite have Roman-derived forenames; we also meet a character called Seneca Crane). Unlike ""The Running Man"" the film does not idealise or romanticise violence; the organisers of the Games might talk about the ""courage"" and ""sacrifice"" of the tributes, but the film shows the Games for what they are, the savage and completely unnecessary slaughter of frightened young people. I am not normally a big fan of ongoing film franchises, but having seen ""The Hunger Games"" I might give the later episodes a chance. 7/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,

6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ace8,tt1392170,The Hunger Games,itsmshuman,4 December 2023,10,"""The Hunger Games"" is a gripping dystopian adventure directed by Gary Ross, adapted from Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel. Set in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, the film follows Katniss Everdeen, portrayed with intensity by Jennifer Lawrence, as she volunteers to take her sister's place in the annual Hunger Games-a televised fight to the death among young tributes from each district.\nThe film's strength lies in its world-building, presenting a bleak yet fascinating vision of a society divided into districts ruled by the Capitol. The Hunger Games themselves are a brutal spectacle, and Ross captures the tension and drama adeptly. Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the resilient and resourceful Katniss anchors the narrative, bringing depth to the character.\nThe supporting cast, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, adds layers to the story. Stanley Tucci's flamboyant portrayal of Caesar Flickerman and Elizabeth Banks' eccentric Effie Trinket contribute to the film's satirical commentary on reality television and the manipulation of public sentiment.\nVisually, the film is striking, with the stark contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the poverty of the districts. The action sequences are well-executed, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. James Newton Howard's musical score enhances the emotional beats, creating a powerful atmosphere.\nWhile ""The Hunger Games"" successfully introduces audiences to the harsh reality of Panem and establishes Katniss as a formidable protagonist, some may find the shaky camera work during action scenes distracting. Additionally, the film leaves certain aspects of the source material unexplored, assuming familiarity with the book.\nIn summary, ""The Hunger Games"" is a compelling adaptation that sets the stage for the franchise. With its strong performances, thought-provoking themes, and visually arresting presentation, it remains a noteworthy entry in the dystopian film genre, offering both entertainment and social commentary.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,

His latest assignment has gone wrong, and apparently his superiors aren't happy.\nFincher's artistic attempt at a John Wick/Kill Bill style caper has moments of genius, flashes of mastery and stretches of boredom.

I sought out and read the comic when I learned of Fincher's interest and I found the book fairly mediocre - a world-weary hit man's internal monologuing as a paid killing goes sideways and things start coming apart. Meh. Nothing that hasn't been around the block a few times before.\nOf course, it's all the execution of the film adaptation that counts and Fincher is a master of the medium. Graphic novels have become the ""automatic storyboards"" to many a modern movie with results that range all over the place: Sam Mendes' fine THE ROAD TO PERDITION (2002) from Max Allan Collins' solid graphic novel, David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE from the awfully lousy Vertigo comic, to all the terrible-to-okay adaptations of Alan Moore's comics like LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL, V FOR VENDETTA and WATCHMEN, so I guess I should be used to the process. I just didn't see what Fincher saw in the comic.\nI needn't have worried, of course. THE KILLER is a solid, beautifully crafted film from start to finish, improving upon its source in every way. It is a pulp crime novel with an organized world-of-assassins that is similar to the JOHN WICK series but more realistic and lethal with less of the absurd theatrical violence of that film (and its rapidly-diminishing sequels). Michael Fassbender makes a fine protagonist and the detailing of his world view, his profession, and his life are the central core of the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction is solid, and there are subtleties to enjoy in the writing that I'm not sure were there in the graphic novel but I'd need to re-read it to be sure and I'm not sure that I care that much. If you want some pulp fiction and pure entertainment, THE KILLER will give that to you; it's not front-tier Fincher, lacking the depth of his greater works like ZODIAC, SEVEN, and FIGHT CLUB but it is a glossy, fun entertainment.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,

He has a rule about only killing people he has been paid to kill but now he is going to break it and go after the attackers and those that sent them.

Director David Fincher did a fine job creating a good atmosphere in each of the very different locations.

I loved the story, and the film in general outside of the musical portion. I am a very huge fan of musicals, and quite a few movie musicals, but I didn't like the musical part of this one at all. The first problem is that they did the thing that you see in many cheap and lazy musicals, like the ones you used to see on Disney Channel, where they have the actors record the songs edit and mix and master to songs until they sound unnatural, and then put them back over the footage so terribly that it barely matches up. This will always look and sound bad, and make the filmmakers look lazy. There are ways to record after and make it sound good, in fact people used to do it by dubbing a completely different person. Another large complaint I had was the way they filmed the dance numbers. A big complaint about many mediocre movie musicals is that they cut too much in the numbers, and this movie was another culprit of too many cuts. It is not just that there were to many, it was that they had no purpose. While purposeful cuts can elevate a number, the cuts in this movie brought it down. I also personally was not a big fan of the songs in general. In conclusion, it was an awesome movie, but a terrible musical.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,

Well, I should have even lowered them further. So far, enough has been said about the music. About how bad it is; and it really is bad, with just very few exceptions. I could have looked beyond that fact, being a musician myself I try to be less critical, a bit more open minded when it comes to musical numbers in movies. But in Wonka that's hard to ignore as it was just one bad song after another, sometimes crippling the already crippled super-predictible storytelling. Obviously the whole story is about Wonka but more depth often is added to other characters. You like them, you feel for them, you want them to succeed. I didn't care much for any other character, neither did my kids, they didn't care much for Noodles either. All of them seemed shallow and boring, including the villains, perhaps even Wonka himself, as I felt we were all waiting for the moment his personality would flourish and make us root for him till the end. Instead, it was more like looking forward for it to be over.\nIn my sons's own words ""The scenery was great, the story...meh!"". In my teenage daughters' words ""this is so cringe"" (she still thinks Chalamet is very cute though). To be fair, there's very little in life teenagers don't find cringe. But this is coming form a couple of Willy Wonka movie fans, they both love and still watch the Wilder and Depp's versions. This one they said they're OK not to watch it ever again.\nIt felt to me at times like I was watching a TV musical presentation or episode, where you kind of expect mediocre numbers and flat storytelling, because that is exactly what Wonka was. Sadly there's not a whole lot to choose from at the theatres right now and we had seen previews for Wonka that seemed promising, we all felt let down.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,
6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9acfb,tt6166392,Wonka,farthingtonwisemore,2 January 2024,1,"Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet's performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.\nThe film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothy Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.\nOne has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,

He has proven himself more than capable of taking on serious characters and pulling off many incredibly moving performances - ""Beautiful Boy"" and ""Call Me by Your Name"" are just two that come to mind. That said, he throws off those gowns and that image , and fully embraces the fun, family film genre in this whimsical festive-esque film.\nUnder the incredibly clear and concise direction and vision of Paul King, this iteration of Willy Wonka is a charming, bright-eyed youth full of positive enthusiasm and endearing energy to make the world a better place through ""making chocolate, of course!"" - to borrow a line from the titular character.\nSome standout performances come from Olivia Colman and Paterson Joseph, as Mrs Scrubitt and Arthur Slugworth respectively. Both villains are so sickly bitter that they're almost a metaphor for the opposite of the sweet (good) characters of Wonka, Noodle, Lofty, and the workhouse gang.\nOne criticism that has been commonplace about this film is the lack of off-kilter weirdness about Willy Wonka.

Still don't entirely get Chalamet, but he's game, sings at least as well as Gene Wilder, and dances a bit, quite capably. I didn't realize it was a brand-new story from Paul King, and it's quite a dexterous one, giving Wonka a credible origin story and allowing for plenty of sight gags, warmth, and satire.  Calah Lane is adorable, and there are fun turns from Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Colman, Rowan Atkinson, and, especially, Hugh Grant. It's visually sumptuous, especially in IMAX. The new songs, by somebody I never heard of, are just fine-OK, they have some lazy rhymes, but they tell the story, inform us about the characters, and generally do the heavy lifting musical scores used to do.

Loved this side of it, and I remember seeing lots of YouTube videos that went over all the details and how they are connected to real life or to other media. It also has a really good pacing, and overall feels more like an adult fairytale. Which may not be something for everyone, obviously.\nI remember when it just came out a lot of people were praising the show for how females are portrayed, and bashed it for how males are portrayed. And there were some who did the reverse. I would say that both sides are correct. Not to go too much into details, patriarchy is depicted as the evil of the world, and matriarchy is the only way to save it. This is not only not true, but it is also shallow, and ignoring real examples of matriarchic rule.\nAt the same time, the movie does touch upon real issues that men face in real life, like the need to fight for even a slither of attention. This is good, but it gets kind of brushed off at the end, almost as if it did not matter, that that's what brought about Kendome. ""Kenough"" shirt is a good message, but it gets overpowered by the main message, that it is enough for women to just be ordinary. Which is also a good message, but...\nThe movie just forgot that in reality you need equality. You need both sides to be present and finding common ground. It is ok to be ordinary for both sides, and both sides can do amazing things. To be honest, for more than first half of the movie, I thought that would be the final message, but in the end it was muddied by ""women are better"", which felt disingenuous and worsened overall experience. The final scene, though did even more damage, but maybe I just did not get it, since I am a guy.\nEither way, it was more or less an enjoyable experience. Overhyped? Probably yes. Worth a watch?

Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third.

James Caan also plays the part of the reluctant father so well that you wonder if he's actually going to kill Buddy.

And it has a decent soundtrack that has lots of festive tunes to keep the yuletide feel alive. Now a few might argue with my reasoning here. But the biggest drawback for me is the rewatchability. Take Scrooged with Bill Murray as an example. I will never , ever tire of seeing the ghost of Christmas present smash Bill Murrays face with a toaster. Still laugh as hard every year. Elf unfortunately for me, made me laugh the first time. But Subsequent viewings don't bring the same enjoyment as the jokes are ""seen it, heard it"" and have limited replay value. I did enjoy the movie and Ferrel. Love him or loathe him, does what he does best and borders on the farcical with a style that only he can provide. Perhaps that's the problem. Ferrel's rewatchability in most of his work is not the easiest as his work depends a lot on the shock factor which diminishes each time you see it. A movie like Airplane I could watch countless times and still be amused. Elf for me is only slightly rewatchable and If it wasn't for my Daughter wanting to watch in 2023.

Telling an whimsical tale of a misplaced orphan reuniting with family, the story gives such charm and emotion to masterfully capture the spirit of Christmas.

Portraying Buddy the Elf, Will Farrell gives one of his most memorable performances, balancing his childlike attitude with an infectious holiday spirit. Elf achieves more than most holiday films, as it focuses on its characters and story and then uses the holiday to accentuate the experience.

And I love it!\nElf centers around Buddy (played by Will Ferrell), a 30-year-old man, who as a orphaned baby, snuck into Santa Clause's (Ed Asner) sack on Christmas Eve, at the orphanage that he lived in. After being brought back to the North Pole by mistake, Buddy was raised by one of Santa's elves, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), and grew up thinking his entire life that he was an elf... despite being three times the size of the other elves, and being the slowest at making toys. Upon learning that he's a human, Buddy departs from the North Pole and travels down to New York City, without shedding his elf garments, to meet his birthfather, Walter Hobs (James Caan)... who turns out to be a cynical and self-centered businessman, and on Santa's naughty list. Because Walter never even knew that Buddy was born, he takes Buddy to a doctor for a DNA test, and finds, to his dismay, that Buddy is indeed his son. As a result, Walter is forced to start a relationship with Buddy. And the results get more and more chaotic.\nThe acting is brilliant. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy. James Caan (may he rest in peace) is magnificent as Walter. I really like the contrast that their performances create between Buddy and Walter. While Buddy is incredibly good-natured and kind, but naive and simple-minded, Walter is cynical and small-minded. Ed Asner (may he also rest in peace) is perfect as Santa. Zooey Deschanel is really good as Jovie, the resentful, standoffish Gimbels employee that Buddy falls for. She starts off bitter and cold, but really softens up as the movie goes on. Plus, she has an amazing singing voice.\nThe movie is also jam-packed with comedy that hits every right note! Favorite scenes of mine include Buddy chugging 2 whole liters of Coke and then unleashing a KILLER 12-second burp (dubbed in by Maurice LaMarche, one of the most brilliant voice-actors alive), getting into a fight with the Gimbels Santa after discovering that he's fake, wandering into the women's locker room when he hears Jovie singing in the shower, putting syrup and candy all over a plate of spaghetti (Mmmmm!), and answering a phone call meant for Walter: ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" HA! Oh, and the scene of him mistaking renowned children's author Miles Finch (played by the FLAWLESSLY cast Peter Dinklage) for an elf. PRICELESS! The movie is also heartwarming at times, like with Buddy and Jovie's falling-in-love montage, and Walter finally warming up to Buddy.\nThe music is also great! I panned John Debney's score for Home Alone 6, but his score for this movie is beautiful and amazing, and really sells that Christmas vibe. The songs choices are also really good.\nEverything considered, Elf is a triumph at Christmas uplift and comedy, and one of my favorites to watch at Christmas. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself! You'll be laughing like crazy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,

While there was a chaotic energy when Kevin was left home alone, everything is elevated when he is alone in New York. The Plaza Hotel, Duncan's Toy Chest, the taxi ride over the Manhattan Bridge, standing atop the World Trade Center, the list goes on and on about Kevin's adventure in this film.\nWhile you have to suspend belief at the convenience of Harry & Marv running into Kevin again, their beatdown is absolutely marvelous. The thumping that Kevin gives to Marv specifically is legendary. The amount of brain damage or near death experiences given to that man in this film is too much to count.\nThe pigeon lady is a bit rough around the edges, but the turtle love moment gives me the feels.

Since I can remember I've been totally enamoured with the appearance of lights in the dead of night, and their is a lot of those shots in this film, which I wholeheartedly appreciate. The clout that came from the first Home Alone, means that they production got to film in so many fantastic New York locations, like the Carnegie Hall and Rockafella Center. Kevin McCallister has always struck me as an incredibly clever kid, he is portrayed by the talented Macaulay Culkin, and he manages to showcase the smart as a whip personality without coming across as an arrogant. He also seems to have a magnetic charm that simply captures the affection to both children and adults alike. The aspect of the turtle doves was a nice inclusion, to be able to show to the audience the selfless nature of Kevin through his actions. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return to their roles as the thieves, and once again you have Joe Pesci playing the straight man, his styling of comedy in this film is brilliant to watch as he looks down upon Kevin with utter disdain.

Home Alone 2, however? Right up there alongside the original! In fact, I actually like it slightly better.\nFirst off, the story. Once again, the McCallister Family is planning a Christmas trip, this time to Miami. And of course, the night before, Kevin (played by Macaulay Culkin, reprising his role just this once) gets in trouble for acting out and causing a mess again, only this time, when his nasty older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) humiliates him during his choir solo at a school Christmas pageant, while as usual, Buzz gets away scot-free, because Kevin's mom, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), apparently didn't learn her lesson. This time, though, instead of the alarm clocks getting reset by a power outage caused by an overnight blizzard, they're reset by Kevin's father, Peter (John Heard), stupidly unplugging them and then plugging them back in. And instead of getting left behind in the chaos, Kevin does wake up in time for his family to not forget him... but gets separated from them in the mad dash through the airport after he stops to replace the batteries in his tape recorder. And in the confusion, Kevin ends up going to New York City instead of Miami, and takes his dad's bag with him. Using his dad's credit card, Kevin illegally books himself a suite at the Plaza Hotel. But once again, he encounters Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), who escaped from jail, and have snuck away to to rob toy stores. It's up to Kevin to stop them from robbing Duncan's Toy Chest just before Christmas.\nOf course, none of the characters have changed since the first movie. Kevin is still the likeable protagonist he originally was. Harry and Marv are still the goofy burglars they were in the first movie. And of course, both Buzz and Kevin's rude uncle Frank (Gerry Bamman) are still the jerks they were in the first movie (though they do thank Kevin at the end).\nThe acting, of course, is fantastic. Everybody returns to their roles from the first movie, and their performances are just as great. Macaulay Culkin, in particular, still displays the same charisma as Kevin that he did in the first movie. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are still as hilarious as Harry and Marv as they were in the first movie. In regards to the new characters, Tim Curry is incredibly funny as the Concierge. Rob Schneider is equally amusing at times as Cedric, the bellboy.\nAnd as you would expect from John Hughes, the writing is fabulous! All the humor in this movie makes me laugh every time. Especially the booby traps that Kevin lays down for Harry and Marv in his uncle Rob's empty house. So what if most of the humor is retreaded from the first movie?! What's important is that it's still funny, and a heckuva lot better than, say, the utter mean-spiritedness of Home Alone 6. Plus, Kevin comes up with some fresh, new traps for Harry and Marv. Other fresh, new jokes the movie has in store include the scene where Kevin records Uncle Frank singing tunelessly in the shower, only to get caught (""GET OUTTA HERE, YOU NOSY LITTLE PERVERT, OR I'M GONNA SLAP YOU SILLY!!!!""), and later uses that recording and an inflatable clown to scare off the Concierge. The movie is also heartwarming at times, like when Kevin befriends the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker), even if she's a carbon copy of Old Man Marley from the first movie.\nAnd of course, there's the music. John Williams returned to score this movie, and he did a FABULOUS job. He weaved in the melody to ""Somewhere In My Memory"" from the first movie, and even co-wrote two wonderful new songs: ""Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas"", and the CHILLINGLY beautiful ""Christmas Star"".\nIn short, out of all the Home Alone sequels, this is the only one that comes out just as good as, or even better, than the classic original.

6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ad1b,tt0104431,Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,alekspredator87,5 December 2023,10,"The sequel. It's always a difficult topic. The second part after the first successful film should be no less cool, but it often happens that it is the sequels that ruin the wonderful original stories. To my great pleasure, ""Home Alone 2"" became that gorgeous sequel, about which you can always say without a shadow of a doubt that the sequel turned out to be very worthy. And this movie, like the first one, can be endlessly reviewed every Christmas and New Year.\nDirector Chris Columbus follows the classic precepts of the sequel. He repeats the story of the first film, but complicates the plot and makes everything much bigger. It is unlikely that it will be news to anyone that the main character Kevin will be lost again. However, now he has to find himself not just alone at home, but alone in New York, one of the largest cities on the planet. And here the boy will not lose face, but thanks to a successful combination of circumstances, he will try to spend the holidays to the fullest. But old acquaintances Harry and Marv will break into his life again. Wet bandits gracefully ""mimic"" into sticky bandits, and the confrontation between them and the now ten-year-old boy will make you enjoy watching what is happening on the screen.\nThe painting repeats its original very much. It's noticeable. But at the same time, the creators are ready to offer something special that will connect the story with the first film, as if recalling what happened a couple of years ago, but at the same time will present something unique. The film is full of good jokes, hilarious falls, bumps and other attractions, where the screen villains will get much stronger than last time. But all these repetitions look good, there is no sense of incongruity. Rather, on the contrary, I want to see Kevin defeat his rivals again and again. That's why it's a fairy tale, so that the good turns out to be stronger, and everything that happens (though sometimes deadly) was made up.\nActing, as before, is on top. The trio of main characters holds up perfectly in the frame. Macaulay Culkin has grown up a little, it feels like he has become adept at acting. But Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci remained the same. These are all the same native villains, whom you empathize with more and more often, realizing how many times guys have already had to die from one trap or another. Once I even came across a video where it was calculated how many times the villains would have died for both Columbus films. In general, they would have no chance of survival.\nThe second picture, like the first, creates an amazing Christmas atmosphere, literally full of bright green and red flowers. The abundance of colors allows you to get into the spirit of Christmas and New Year, and the setting of the story leaves no chance for the film to become an unshakable classic, which more than one generation has been reviewing every year and, hopefully, will continue.\nThe film is full of dynamics, memorable supporting characters. What are the appearances of a whole ensemble of comedic incarnations, including Tim Curry, Rob Schneider and Dan Ivey. Their characters in the huge hotel were very funny. The others are also good.\nBut, as before, the relationship between a mother and a young son comes to the fore. Even if they are copied, we saw the development of the characters' relationships in the first picture, in this case, it seems to me, it would not be superfluous to repeat and convey to the viewer that the most important thing in life is family. Despite all the possible hardships, it is always important to remember who the people closest to you are.\n""Home Alone 2"" is a good and interesting story that is definitely worth putting on the list for viewing at least on New Year's holidays. This is a perfectly packaged (as a gift) story of family vicissitudes, interesting action and, of course, an incredible fairy tale that you want to continue to believe in.\n10 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,
6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ad1c,tt8337264,Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget,rugb,1 January 2024,6,"Apparently this film's creators didn't bring back certain key actors from the original film for fear of controversial pasts and ""old"" sounding voices. If that's true, and despite whether it would've hurt or not, they worried about the wrong thing. The creators should've been more concerned with the subpar writing and directing that makes this film unwatchable a 2nd time and keeps it out of my Aardman collection.\nI give the animation and cinematography at least a 9 out of 10. Visually, it meets expectation. I give the story concept and voice acting at least a 7. It's sort of a typical tale of a teen rebelling against parent wishes, but at least told in a worthwhile way, and stays consistent with the action and characters to the end. The replacement voice actors do a decent job, imo. They're not as good and sometimes go through the motions (even the return actors), but they sound similar enough and don't botch it.\nFrom those angles, this wouldn't be a bad sequel. However, everything else is well below standard for Aardman. It lacks wit, heart, originality and personality. Most jokes are straightforward, flat, overtly juvenile and overdone at times. Some of the music, additional voices and sounds do not flow. They sound cheaply done and formulaic.\nIt's as if the film's creators had no sense of what made people like the original film or any of the Wallace & Gromit catalogue. As if they expected to have an entirely new, unaware audience to depend on. One that didn't need to see the first film and is made up of easily-impressed 10 year-olds or moms whose film appreciation runs entirely through a kid-only, G-rated filter. There's nothing wrong with G-rated, but this effort abandoned every adult fan with a sense of humor, who appreciates subtlety and creativity - the way Aardman used to ""craft"" a film.\nI literally only laughed at one brief scene. I rewound it a couple times because it was reminiscent of the original film. The scene involves Rocky suggesting a rescue plan that lacks plan, then Bunty and Mac give him grief over it. Mac makes a hilarious analogy which is made even funnier by her Scottish brogue.\nI also thought ""Reginald"" was a redeeming character and played reasonably well by Peter Serafinowicz. But that was it. Nothing else stood out about this film other than how much it didn't stand out. Like someone else noted, I wanted to like this. I knew 20 minutes into that it was not going to be ""great"" but I watched to the end with hopes that it would at least finish ""good."" However, it is only just ""okay"" on a good day. To me, if you're going to make this effort 23 years later, why not make a proper effort?\nI'm also baffled by how many reviewers ""understand"" why Gibson wasn't recalled. He had a degree of detractors even when he did the original film. He's still a viable and good actor today, and has been churning out films the past 3-4 years, including six in 2022. Most are rubbish, but he had a few good films and spectacular performances in the past decade.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,

To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement - phenomenal follow up after all these years!\nI'll address the immediate elephant in the room with this movie - the original was obviously a play on The Great Escape, while the sequel is not a satire of any previous movie/story to my knowledge. I think that's a bit of a miss, but knowing that before hand hopefully sets expectations.\nOutside of no longer being a unique satire, the movie itself is about as enjoyable as it gets. Is the plot groundbreaking? No. Are there some plot holes and maybe a bit of head scratching over the general concept? Sure. But...they're stop motion chickens. If you're hyper-fixated on plot, I doubt you're watching.\nWhat I had to admit to within about 15 minutes is the joke writing is *better* than the original. Chicken Run is a delightful satire with a great storyline, but watching as an adult shocked me a bit due to the lack of actually funny dialogue. This sequel is absolutely full of them though, at times having non stop one-liners and puns with Arrested Development-like pacing.\nEnd of the day, this is just a phenomenally enjoyable movie. I think they could have developed a slightly more interesting/cohesive plot, but the lines and animation is so fun, who honestly cares. Great fun and will undoubtably be a great rewatch for years, just like the original.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,

Now 23 years later I'm seeing this excellent sequel that picks off from the first.\nThe first film had Mel Gibson's voice acting talent as Rocky The Rooster. Here sadly he is missed. I thought he aught to reprise his role one last time... Zachary Levi(Shazam! 2019) takes over the role of Rocky. He does a decent job however Mel Gibson was way more experienced and versatile as an actor.\nWe also see Thandiwe Newton(The Pursuit of Happyness 2006) take over the role of Ginger the chicken from the original actress Julia Sawalha(Absolutely Fabulous TV Sitcom).\nThe plot of the animated film concerns the birth of Rocky and Ginger's daughter Molly and a new chicken nugget processing factory that opens up in the vicinity of the little island sanctuary they live on.\nVerdict: excellent and also worth watching again. Excellent tongue-in-cheek humor and superb direction and background music. The characterization was also well done as well as the script.

It's a family favourite around these parts, and one which holds up to repeat viewing today. This sequel, made without the involvement of Nick Park, feels like a cheap Hollywood cash-in and can't be mentioned in the same breath. The absence of Park and the ludicrous recasting of Julia Sawalha in particular didn't bode well for it, and Newton and Levi are both as bland as you'd expect.

6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ad27,tt0338348,The Polar Express,gccuconati,25 December 2023,10,"Merry Christmas, everybody! My older brother and I have a little Christmas tradition, in which before going to bed on Christmas Eve, we watch the beloved animated Christmas film, The Polar Express. In fact, my brother still remembers when we first saw it on TV in our hotel room on a trip to Barcelona, back in Spring 2005 (when I was barely 2, and he was 5). And it still holds up nineteen years later!\nBased on Chris Van Allsburg's 1985 children's picture book of the same name, The Polar Express takes place at Christmas sometime in the 1950's, and centers on a young boy, simply known as the Hero Boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, movements by Tom Hanks), who does not believe in Santa Claus. However, on Christmas Eve, he takes an amazing train trip to the North Pole, along with many other kids, and sets out on a journey of self-discovery, where he soon learns that the mysteries and wonders of life never fade for those who truly believe. In other words, it puts a strong new twist on the meaning of Christmas spirit by representing it as a test of faith. And director, producer and co-screenwriter Robert Zemeckis did a flawless job of adapting the book faithfully, and he also expanded the universe to make it into a feature-length film, by adding new situations and characters; namely a girl known as the Hero Girl (speaking voice and movements by Nona Gaye, singing voice by Meagan Moore), a lonely boy named Billy (speaking voice by Jimmy Bennett, singing voice by Matthew Hall, movements by Peter Scolari), a nerdy boy known as the Know-it-all Kid (Eddie Deezen), and the disappearing hobo (Tom Hanks).\nThe animation is extraordinary! This was the first movie ever to entirely use motion-capture animation, and it's aged like wine. Zemeckis managed to flawlessly implement the designs from Van Allsburg's illustrations into the models, and the faces of the Hero Boy and all the other kids in the movie, even the Hero Boy's little sister Sarah (voiced by Isabella Peregrina, movements by Leslie Zemeckis) still look exactly right for their age. You really can't tell that their movements were done by adults! The color scheme and sceneries, likewise, are downright gorgeous, and Zemeckis's dynamic camera moves and editing just add to it. The only problem is that sometimes, the characters' eyes look a little dead, resulting in some mild creepiness. But when it comes to mo-cap animation, I've definitely seen worse (Mars Needs Moms, anyone?).\nAnd all of the characters are excellently developed! The Hero Boy is a very engaging and compelling protagonist. The Hero Girl, likewise, is very sweet, kind, and resourceful. Billy is also very trusting and well-developed. As for the Know-it-all Kid, though he's meant to be annoying and does come off that way at times, he's also super quotable and funny. But the Conductor (Tom Hanks) is my favorite character in the movie! He's very businesslike, and gets some of the best lines. The train's crew, Smokey and Steamer (both Michael Jeter, in his final performance before his death) are great comic relief characters (especially when Steamer breaks the throttle!). And the hobo is very helpful at times.\nThe voice-acting is amazing! Daryl Sabara supplies a certain earnestness as the Hero Boy. As the Hero Girl, Nona Gaye demonstrates that even at 30, she has the range to play a 12-year-old girl. Eddie Deezen is fittingly nerdy as the Know-it-all Kid. Jimmy Bennett retains that classic child's innocence as Billy. But in this movie, Tom Hanks really gets to show off his fabulous vocal range! While flawlessly using his natural voice as the Conductor and as the Hero Boy's adult narration, he gives a good, gravelly voice to the hobo, and a big, deep dignified voice to Santa.\nBefore wrapping things up, let me talk about the music. Zemeckis regular Alan Silvestri, also the genius behind the scores for Lilo and Stitch and Night at the Museum, delivered a beautiful, Christmassy score for this movie! And the original Christmas songs that he co-wrote with Glen Ballard are fabulous. ""Hot Chocolate"" is a very fun song that my brother and I like to sing along to, and so is the title song. In regards to the slower songs, ""When Christmas Comes to Town"", sung by Billy and the Hero Girl, is chillingly beautiful, and the same can be said for ""Believe"" in the end credits. While I rarely think highly of Josh Groban, the way he sings ""Believe"" just makes it a better song than it normally would be. The movie also fabulously chooses really good 40s/50s-era recordings of classic Christmas songs, including ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" by Frank Sinatra.\nAll in all, The Polar Express is a sublime Christmas classic for several reasons. The animation is innovative and beautiful, the characters are marvelous, the music is wonderful, the script is excellent, the pacing is perfect, and it stays fully faithful to Van Allsburg's work. As such, it's a fabulous movie, and a compulsory viewing for Christmas.\nOh, by the way...

I get it that these special effects were ""cutting edge"" at the time and yet, seeing how much further the technology has come with films like the Avatar franchise, this one just has a weird, unreality to it, like they hadn't quite figured it out, leaving us to watch these characters that are animated yet soulless mannequins, like something reanimated in a Lovecraftian fiction. Faces don't seem to move right, eyes don't quite track, mouths don't seem to be completely expressive. This is truly the ""uncanny valley"" on display and you never really get used to it, like these abominations could turn at any moment, spring out of the television and chase you down the street.\nAdding to the creepiness is that they take these inhuman characters and put them into a frigid environment of endless snow and frozen lakes, but where strangely no one ever gets cold (except for the viewer) . Perhaps these bizarre, lifeless creations are impervious to the effects of the cold? Who knows.\nProbably the single most troubling part of the film to me was when the three primary characters are lost wandering around the claustrophobic North Pole city, devoid of anyone except for the eerie reverb of old Christmas music echoing through the streets. Lights in windows don't reveal a warm home of elf families eating dinner or anything but rather show only abandoned record players. What sort of nightmarish landscape is this?\nI will give mention to the music, as Alan Silvestri did a nice job with the score and incorporating old familiar melodies, although I was left puzzled with the primary leitmotif that sounded weirdly similar to the Buddy the Elf motif from Elf (2003) a year earlier.

Along the way, the makes friends with a girl, a know-it all, and a lonely boy named Billy.\nWhat I like about this movie is how the characters and movie scenes replicates the illustrations of Chris Van Allsburg's book. I even like the scenes where the kids are served hot chocolate, the Hobo and the boy skiing on the roof, the train going down glacier gulch, the wide observation car ride, the ride in Santa's sack, and Santa giving out the first gift of Christmas.\nThis movie is one of the best Christmas movies and it is fun to watch it as a family, and see it in theaters when it is rereleased.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,

Those were my picks, the majority said they wanted ""The Polar Express"". Now I know this is a kids film, but this film didn't really interest me even as a kid. Up until the age of 9 or 10 this film where I started to take my disinterest on the film.\nThe animation style is rough and the characters are creepy looking, they don't talk it's more of a lip sync. And the effects are unimaginative at best. It really does look like a still image of a moving picture, and it's the same snowy scene after snowy scene, it's a spitting image of the same exact sequence. Not to mention, the movie is way to loud. The audio on this movie is very rough, loud and a bit obnoxious. It certainly is deafening to the ears.\nThe scenes that play out in the movie do seem rushed at times. Like why was their a whole minute of the lost ticket scene, heroically finding it's way back as if by magic. And it was the exact same the whole way through. Sequences after Sequence that are just their to feel up the time gap.\nBut, with any movie and TV siries, despite flaws their will always be some highlights or something good in the movie. I do like the idea of a magical train going to the North Pole, and the kids that get to go are the ones that believe in Santa. The scenes with them on the train are great, and the kids all have a bond with each other. Mostly being stereotypical counterparts though. So overall, the film hasn't aged quite that well. And the scene where the waiters were bringing out Hot chocolate, that looked like it was from a video game.\nSo, Would I recommend this film?\nUnless you want some Christmas spirit then yes definitely, otherwise just watch a different film instead like ""Home Alone"".",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,

They talk about presents all throughout the film. When they arrive at the North Pole, they talk about the ""first gift"" of Christmas, which is a present. And, you wonder why our society is so materialistic today.\nIn reality, Christmas is a religious holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Santa Claus is based on Saint Nicholas, a Catholic saint who would give gifts to people in Jesus Christ's name. The ""first gift"" of Christmas is the birth of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

It felt like the best goodbye: timed perfectly, achingly beautiful, haunting, and genuine. The artwork is, of course, masterful. Many of the landscapes took my breath away completely. The character design is classic Ghibli (very aligned with Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle) and weird in the best of ways. The film was more suspenseful than I expected from the description, which was a fun surprise. But the real delight of this film is in how deeply personal it is. I felt like I was seeing something private, like a pouring out of Miyazaki's soul. It was a surreal synthesis of the best of Ghibli and the fears of an artist with boundless imagination and a vulnerable inner child. The film wrestles with issues of war and human malice, belonging and sense of place, escapism versus reality, temporal relationships, and grief. I will need to watch it about 10 more times to catch even a fraction of the symbolism, but it's such a moving tale that I'm looking forward to that hunt for its meaning.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,
6595b4d6a783f0cdafc9ad31,tt6587046,Kimitachi wa dô ikiru ka,gcsman,1 January 2024,8,"""Princess Mononoke"" is the only other Miyazaki film that I've seen (which is clearly my loss). Just saw The Boy and the Heron in its subtitled (not dubbed) English version at one of our local independent cinemas, and it's quite an experience. To say the least, Miyazaki has an inventive mind. The overarching theme of the story is that young Mahito embarks on a journey to meet (or save?) his mother, thought by everyone to have died in a fire the year before. But that summary conveys almost nothing of what happens on screen. We are step by step taken into an increasingly bizarre wonderland of human and non-human, good and evil characters who alternately guide Mahito, or hinder him, or push him along. He's a naive boy, but not just a cipher to whom things happen: he has a will of his own and is not afraid to assert it at critical times -- but as we see, his judgment isn't always true.\nThere's no doubt that Miyazaki has an impressive visual imagination, which is on full display here. I was struck by the extreme use of 'masking' as an animation technique: the backgrounds, landscapes, and settings both outdoors and indoors are rendered with full, lush detail and striking colors, whereas the main characters are drawn quite simply and generically, which makes it easier for the viewers to put themselves in their place amidst the action. (The exceptions are the odd characters that we would NOT identify with, like the Grandfather or the gnome-like grannies in the country house -- those are drawn in very specific detail.) And there are genuinely arresting concepts that will stay in your mind, like the corridor of doors leading into different worlds (in this movie, the multiverse is digital, not continuous!), or the fire maiden Himi.\nThe strongest impression I came away with, though, was that as the movie went along, I could not predict what we were going to see next: the action flows from scene to scene smoothly enough, but with big and sometimes jarring changes in location and sub-theme, as if they didn't want to be held to a single self-consistent storyline. Perhaps I'm just too wedded to Western linear thinking. This story is coming from a truly different place.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,

So much so to the point where I kept asking myself ""What the hell am I watching!?"". I don't know what went on in Miyazaki's head making this film, but after watching this I started loosing interest in anime entirely.\nOn the sidenote, the English dubbing could be better.

It follows the adventures of ""Mahito"" who arrives at the home of his factory-owning father amidst WWII. We appreciate quickly that his mother has died and that he is to have a new, expectant, mother in ""Natsuko"". When she mysteriously disappears and ""Mahito"" finds his presence ""requested"" by an enigmatic and beautiful grey heron, he strays into an old abandoned tower on his family estate and is soon embroiled in a world inhabited by people who are alive and, well, not! It seems the heron is not quite what it seemed, either, as he must explore rooms within rooms and endless doors that open into new scenarios. Pursued by giant pelicans, how can ""Mahito"" find his stepmother and return safely to their home? Luckily, along the way, he encounters the benevolently spiritual ""Kiriko"" as he finds himself the subject of some clever manipulation between the outwardly benign ""Grand Uncle"" who draws the power of life from a giant sacred stone he wishes to leave in the custody of our young explorer and the ambitious ""Pelican King"". You simply cannot fail to admire the vivid imagination of Miyazaki - the ideas and apparent randomness of the threads that gradually come together is hard enough to follow sometimes even when you have seen the denouement, and that's what makes these intricately drawn and characterised stories usually more intriguing and enjoying.

I did not expect to like this movie at all with all the bad video game movies we have had, but lately is is starting to change. Like with sonic this movies stays close to what the video games is about and does not try to stray further away from it than necessary. The fact that this movie is actually an origin story to Mario(and donkey Kong too) was unexpected but narratively it made a lot of sense. With the addition of all the little Easter eggs and really good western style animation a had a good time watching this movie. The plot on the other hand was very basic but that is not really the reason anyone would watch a movie like this( maybe some movie critics that don't really get it). The movie stayed consistent with its characters and Mario had a nice little arc for himself aswell.

The reactions in the theaters were so amazing.\nAnd yes, the story is pretty thin and not the most original, but it still is a kids movie, and this move did not have the goal to make an amazing new story, just to amuse the people watching the movie who are also familiar to the games.\nFor me, this remains one of the best videogame adaptations yet.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,

Here is an example of how you can structure your review:\n---\n# Trolls Band Together: A Musical Adventure with Heart and Humor\nTrolls Band Together is the third installment in the animated Trolls franchise, and it might be the best one yet. The film follows Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake), who are now officially a couple, as they embark on a quest to reunite Branch's long-lost brothers and rescue one of them from a pair of evil pop stars. Along the way, they encounter new friends, old enemies, and a lot of catchy songs.\nThe film's plot is simple but engaging, with enough twists and surprises to keep the audience entertained. The themes of family, friendship, and music are explored with warmth and humor, and the film delivers a positive message about not letting anyone steal your talent or your joy. The character development is also well-done, as we see Poppy and Branch grow closer and learn more about each other's pasts, while also meeting new characters who have their own personalities and arcs. The film's overall impact is uplifting and fun, with a satisfying conclusion that celebrates the power of love and music.\nThe director, Walt Dohrn, does a great job of creating a colorful and vibrant world for the trolls, with a distinctive style that blends 2D and 3D animation. The film is visually stunning, with a lot of attention to detail and creativity. The musical sequences are especially impressive, with a variety of genres and styles that showcase the talents of the voice cast and the original songs. The performances of the actors are also excellent, with Kendrick and Timberlake leading the way with their charm and chemistry. The supporting cast is also stellar, with notable roles by Troye Sivan, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi, Amy Schumer, and Andrew Rannells.\nThe film's strengths are its music, its humor, and its heart. The film has a great soundtrack, with songs that are catchy, funny, and emotional. The film also has a lot of jokes and references that will appeal to both kids and adults, especially those who grew up in the '90s and are familiar with boy bands and pop culture. The film also has a lot of heart, with scenes that are touching and sincere, and characters that are likable and relatable. The film's weaknesses are few and minor, such as some clichés and stereotypes, some predictable moments, and some scenes that might be too scary or sad for younger children.\nOverall, Trolls Band Together is a delightful and enjoyable film that will make you laugh, sing, and feel good. It is worth recommending to anyone who likes animated films, musicals, or trolls. It is a film that will make you want to band together with your loved ones and celebrate life.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,

Only this time, it's all about boybands. Boyzone, N*Sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, etc. You gotta be a music lover or a child to enjoy this movie.

We went to the late show, and had the theater to ourselves. My kids were really excited.\nMy nine year old son quickly realized this is not a movie in which there is a strong story. The movie is more of a musical, with a song seemingly every 30 seconds. Gone are the days of the trolls action and adventure. Disappointing.\nThis film introduces so many ""famous"" people (I assume, however researching the actors on IMDB and I'm not sure who 98% of them are) that you quickly get lost in who is who, and what story the film is trying to tell. So many characters were introduced, but were never fully explained or developed, which made the story hard to follow and comprehend.\nThe film has two competing stories, well, three if you count the ""everyone finds their long lost family"" aspect. Too many competing themes, for any of them to shine through, again making the movie hard to comprehend.\nThe most ridiculous thing of all? The characters say extremely inappropriate things for a film directed at children. At one point, one character says to the other ""I thought I was the only one getting tied up."" There is gratuitous use of male genitalia and sex innuendos. CONTINUOUSLY repeated throughout the film.\nI'm blown away that the actors said some of these lines. How did they deem these appropriate for children? Did they not realize this is a CHILDREN'S film? I shouldn't be explaining to my nine year old son what a female means by being tied up. Absolutely abhorrent.\nI've never considered Hollywood to be any type of role model, for any person on the face of planet Earth, nor will I ever, however, it is still somehow shocking to me that they continue to PROVE that their society and industry has zero morals, standards, values, or respect.\nI never would waste the short time I have on Earth to write such a scathing review, but have not been this disappointed in a movie like this in quite some time.

6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad4d,tt14362112,Trolls Band Together,GusherPop,9 December 2023,9,"The Trolls movies, despite being technically a bit of IP-mining, have managed to inject creativity into a seemingly dead-end idea. The series, now a full trilogy, is best when working itself up into a state of tuneful delirium, sending troll queen Poppy (Anna Kendrick) through deeply weird animated landscapes and smashing decades' worth of pop hits along the way. However, the movie opens with an obligatory pathos-laden flashback focusing on Poppy's glum boyfriend Branch (Justin Timberlake). The movie defers this gag until much later, instead filling out the BroZone ranks with Eric André, Troye Sivan, Daveed Diggs, and Kid Cudi. Years after their partnership dissolved, the brothers must reunite to rescue Sivan's Floyd from sibling pop stars Velvet (Amy Schumer) and Veneer (Andrew Rannells), who are sapping his talent to keep their careers afloat. Poppy, a BroZone superfan who had no idea Branch was in the band, is more enthused about this mission than her standoffish partner. DreamWorks' animated ""Trolls"" series is a charming and irresistible movie that is sure to be a hit with millennials. The movie is designed to connect with high school and college years, featuring in-jokes about boy bands and a mix of songs. It's sweet without being sugary, colorful, and charming, with excellent voice talent and a lot of music. It's the best of the three, making it a must-watch for parents and millennials alike. The movies cleverly use popular pop songs and colorful troll designs, with the title ""band"" having a double meaning. In the opening flashback, Branch and his brothers were members of a popular boy band called BroZone, a nod to Timberlake's time with *NSYNC. When their performance went wrong, the group broke up, and Branch and his brothers decided to go back streets. The film also references New Kids on the Block, Menudo, and New Edition, highlighting the transition from boys to men. The ""Trolls"" movies are a thrilling and entertaining story about Floyd, a troll who needs to be rescued. The music, featuring old favorites and new ones, teaches lessons about sibling closeness and accountability. The supporting characters, including Zosia Mamet as Velvet's abused assistant Crimp and Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond, add to the happy atmosphere. The movies also feature songs that feel like home, such as ""9 to 5,"" ""Push It,"" and ""We Are Family."" The film follows several storylines, including the nuptials of Bridget and Gristle, and the unexpected appearance of Viva, who turns out to be Poppy's sister. Some characters from previous films have been dropped or made only token appearances, while new ones include Crimp, Velvet, and Veneer's assistant. The film features an endless series of musical numbers featuring old and new tunes, with an emphasis on the former. The pop earworms, performed energetically by trolls in high voices, include hits from various bands. However, the musical novelty has somewhat worn off, and nothing on the soundtrack matches the catchiness of ""Can't Stop the Feeling"" from the first film, including the ballyhooed ""Better Place,"" for which NSYNC reunited.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,

It has characters that you fall in love with at first sight and characters that you learn to love over the course of the film.

6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad56,tt4729430,Klaus,FelixOneDE,25 December 2023,8,"""Klaus,"" directed by Sergio Pablos, is a charming and inventive animated film that offers a fresh and delightful take on the origins of Santa Claus. This film stands out with its unique storytelling, stunning animation, and a heartwarming message, making it an instant classic in the realm of holiday films.\nThe story follows Jesper, voiced by Jason Schwartzman, a spoiled and lazy postman who is stationed in the remote and feuding town of Smeerensburg. His unlikely friendship with a reclusive toymaker named Klaus, voiced by J. K. Simmons, leads to the creation of Santa Claus's legend. Schwartzman brings a likable and humorous quality to Jesper, effectively portraying his transformation from a selfish individual to a caring member of the community.\nJ. K. Simmons' portrayal of Klaus is both gentle and profound, adding depth and warmth to the character. His performance, along with the film's storytelling, paints a touching and humanized picture of the iconic figure of Santa Claus. The chemistry between Jesper and Klaus drives the narrative, creating a heartwarming dynamic that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant.\nThe animation style of ""Klaus"" is one of its most striking features. The film combines traditional hand-drawn animation with modern techniques, resulting in a visually captivating experience. The character designs are unique and expressive, and the use of lighting and color is innovative, giving the film a sense of depth and texture that is rare in 2D animation.\nThe supporting cast, including Rashida Jones as Alva and Joan Cusack as Mrs. Krum, adds to the film's charm and humor. The characters are well-developed, each contributing to the story in meaningful ways. The voice acting is top-notch across the board, bringing these characters to life with warmth and personality.\nThe script is witty, heartfelt, and cleverly subverts some traditional holiday tropes, providing a fresh perspective on a familiar story. The film explores themes of kindness, forgiveness, and the power of goodwill, delivering its message without feeling preachy or saccharine.\nOne potential downside is that while the film's story is engaging and innovative, it occasionally treads into predictable territory. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment and emotional impact of the film.\nThe soundtrack complements the film's tone perfectly, enhancing both its playful and poignant moments. The music contributes to the overall festive atmosphere of the film, making it a perfect watch for the holiday season.\nIn conclusion, ""Klaus"" is a delightful and visually stunning film that breathes new life into the Santa Claus legend. Its unique animation style, combined with a heartwarming story and memorable characters, makes it a standout animated film. It earns a well-deserved 8 out of 10 for its creativity, emotional depth, and visual beauty, marking it as a modern classic in holiday filmmaking.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3e,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,

You either change everything or change nothing for a minor subset of people on either side. The old Seuss purists deride this story as not faithful, while others deride it as run of the mill with nothing new. After all, what's the point in telling the things exactly the same based on a societal viewpoint decades old, and little point in changing everything including the original message. In the end, the story is about the core of the Christmas spirit with spending and enjoying time with family and friends, not about the material goods that our capitalistic society has pushed. That is the message of Dr. Seuss' original story and of this movie.\nPharrell's narration pays homage to the original animation that felt lacking in the live action Carrey movie. Cindy Lou coming from a single parent home winds up resonating with more families these days, and not the nuclear family ideal from the original story. The Grinch is still humbuggish doing mean things to in an attempt to interrupt other people's happiness. The gadgetry from Dr. Seuss' story's comes to play and fits and looks better in this movie. Finally the lyrical nature of the lines, feels like I'm listening to Dr. Seuss' stories.\nI'm neutral on the redo of the song. Its not bad, but I would have gone with something more along the lines of something Taylor Swift or Kelly Clarkson would sing.\nThings I would have done without is the whole reindeer search and screaming goat, it felt unnecessary. Instead it could have incorporated more of what Cindy Lou tried in the live action movie, while giving the Who's viewpoint of more mean deeds the Grinch had done in the past.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,

It doesn't even have any of the classic Dr Seuss rhymes . Most the characters were a disappointment. For some reason Cindy Loo wasn't really as interesting in this version. I don't know there was no connection to any of the characters. The music was horrible just modern pop and even a rap song? The music is what should stand out and make the movie better and fun but the music was just silly and even a little ridiculous. Just no . No thank you .

This movie thought, it's okay. I think Benedect Cumberland had a very nasal voice for the Grinch. The Grinch himself was just not evil like he was in the book.

""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" (1966) is one of them. Or was one of them until this weekend. While Hades will freeze over before I watch the 2000 non-animated version of the story, I saw this animated 2018 version at Peacock and decided why not? I figured I could turn it off if anything in it offended me, or if it was sacrilegious in any way, shape or form.\nMy, my, all that worrying for nothing! This is an absolutely delightful remake of Dr. Seuss' Christmas story. In two ways it's sweeter than the original, too. One, it explains why the Grinch so hates Christmas. Two, the Grinch is not cruel at all to his dog Max. In this movie, Max is his only friend and companion. There is also a chubby reindeer named Fred, the only one in a huge herd that the Grinch could catch to pull his sled. Fred turned out to be more help than the Grinch ever realized he could be.\nCindy Lou Who is not a toddler in this film, but looks about six years old. She encounters the Grinch on Christmas Eve not by accident, but intentionally, because she wants to ask Santa Claus something. Many of the residents in Whoville are very funny, especially Bricklebaum, who loves Christmas as much as the Grinch hates it. All the voice jobs are great, including the narrator.\nSo, have no fears of watching this movie if you are a fan of the 1966 show, but don't touch the 2000 non-animated version even with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,

This newer version has lots more Grinch interaction. He's not as mean as the original movie.\nThe actors add a new twist on the main characters. Max is the best character.

6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad60,tt2709692,The Grinch,mishahaynie,14 December 2023,4,"Lately, I've been loving Illumination's movies they've been making! With Disney and Pixar on the decline lately, Illumination has really stepped up to the plate with their recent success with the Super Mario Bros movie. I'm excited to see their newest film called 'Migration,' coming out this December. In this adaptation of Dr. Seuss's 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,' Pharrell Williams narrates it because he has a partnership with Illumination. Benedict Cumberbatch voices the Grinch and doesn't sound half bad. Rashida Jones even voices Cindy Lou, whose mother and the girl who plays Cindy Lou Who in this is pretty endearing.\nThe animation is just absolutely breathtaking in this, and they really beautifully recreate Whoville and Mount Crumpet. I really find this version far more palpable and enjoyable for kids compared to the Ron Howard and Jim Carrey nightmare-fueled remake that honestly gave children nightmares and was a whole lot darker. This version is a lot more wholesome to watch and not nearly as creepy. You can tell Illumination really cared about the design and aesthetic of this movie a whole lot, and they put top-notch animators to really bring Dr. Seuss's 'The Grinch' to life in the most honorable way possible.\nThe Grinch is not nearly as mean or diabolical in this adaptation compared to the original and the Jim Carrey version. He's a lot more toned down, and they focus more on how he doesn't feel loved, making him less dastardly than the other previous versions, which I feel is more suitable for kids anyway and still drives the valuable lesson home that no one should feel alone on Christmas. All the Whos are super jolly and positive.\nBut I think what separates this version from the previous versions probably the most is the Whos don't treat the Grinch like a monster. After the Grinch takes everything from the Whos, they honestly are more confused and upset when the Grinch steals everything of theirs but are super forgiving and heartwarmingly compassionate after they find out his tragic tale. Oddly enough, they're not even frightened by him like they are in the originals, which is an interesting take and makes the movie a lot more endearing, I think.\nI think the most lovable character, obviously, is the Grinch's dog, Max, in this movie. They almost give him a Gromit-like personality with a lot of miming and a certain level of endearment. The Grinch is not nearly as cruel to Max as he is in the other two versions, and he is the standout performance that really outshines Benedict Cumberbatch most times throughout the movie with his love and support towards the Grinch that really makes seeing the Grinch's transformation lovable.\nThere's a lot to this movie that is different, but honestly, I think they should have just skipped the whole frightening Jim Carrey version and just created an animated movie to follow up the original to begin with. And I think the Illumination production company really hit the mark with this one and did justice to make this as poetically beautiful and honor the original as much as possible. It's not an instant classic like the original, but it's a really beautiful looking adaptation that's far more suitable for young children to enjoy and still understand the valuable messages to learn from. And honestly, Benedict Cumberbatch's voice as the Grinch sounds incredible, and I think Illumination did a good job. Like this movie or not, I think this is a good and faithful adaptation of the original.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,
6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad61,tt2709692,The Grinch,cizzydean,11 December 2023,4,"The pros: The animation and colors are nice and smooth, the characters and character designs are like-able.\nCons: some painfully unfunny jokes including a butt joke, and a dead meme: the screaming goat (3 times), and the overdone slow motion ""whoa"" moment. Changing an iconic character like Cindy Lou Who from a sweet girl to a hockey loving tomboy felt unnecessary as well. Changing the characters and adding extra ones made this movie feel like it would've been better with a completely different storyline instead of ""retelling"" The Grinch which the live action already did better. The writers also could not let the movie just speak for itself, not only is there a narrator but also The Grinch narrates everything to his dog (and therefore also the audience.) There is a scene where he is covered in icicles and he says ""It's getting really... c-cold, oh goodness!"" I don't see why they had to add this line, it doesn't even sound like something the Grinch would say and I think just having his teeth chatter would have been enough to get the message across. The music was also not good Imo, especially since it was modern pop/rap music with little to no Christmas sound to it in a christmas movie, my least favorite song was the end credits. The only song I thought fit the movie was the acapella carolers but even that song was (imo) not the best choice, especially since it blatantly says the Devil's name which is a little off-putting in a cheery Christmas movie. Also there is a scene with a missing sound effect and another scene where a character's singing abruptly cuts out which was a little weird and made me think ""did anyone rewatch this movie for mistakes before releasing it?""

The film, unfortunately, continues the recent trend of Disney's offerings feeling more like formulaic retreads than the innovative masterpieces we once eagerly anticipated.\nWish stands as a particularly glaring example of this decline. While it boasts a visually appealing watercolor-inspired aesthetic, this artistic choice alone can't mask the movie's fundamental shortcomings. The narrative lacks the depth and nuance that once made Disney films universally appealing. Instead, we're presented with a collection of recycled elements: a predictable protagonist, a cookie-cutter antagonist, a character designed seemingly for merchandising purposes, and a soundtrack that, while competent, fails to leave a lasting impact.\nThe primary audience for Wish is, of course, children. They might find enjoyment in the film, but it's a fleeting and superficial pleasure, akin to the temporary distraction offered by shows like Peppa Pig or Paw Patrol. There's an absence of the magic and inspiration that could make ""Wish"" a memorable experience for its young audience. Ultimately, the film is an example of wasted potential, showcasing high-quality animation without the compelling story or characters needed to make it truly resonate.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

The Netflix animated movie Leo (2023) was a funny and enjoyable animated musical that has good voice acting and good songs that could be funny; there is also some kind of message involving being able to talk to anyone you know about any issues you are having and help you with them.\nAdam Sandler does do a respectable job as Leo, though you might find his voice a bit weird, you will get used to it as you keep watching the movie; he was funny with jokes about how old he is, the years he had lived through, and usually about kids, teachers, and parents. Leo's friend, who stays in the same terrarium in the classroom, Squirtle, who was voiced well by Bill Burr, does have scenes and is usually just talking to Leo when he is talking about escaping or talking to the kids in the classroom; he does eventually help in the third act. I also liked how Leo is trying to do what he can to help the kids in the classroom, because he knows how old he is and how long he has until a certain age that is coming close.\nThe animation is good, and the movie was funny with it having funny lines of dialogue and funny sight gags in the background or as the central focus; the songs in the movie are not bad with them also being funny, and the singing voices from Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are good. What was surprising for me was that the movie had quite a few touching/heartfelt moments that are effective; also, what I will add is that the movie does have a liar reveal story in it that could be annoying, and the movie could have had a shorter runtime because the third act felt a bit stretched out.\nThe Netflix animated movie Leo (2023) was better than I thought it was going to be, and though it is not a perfect animated musical, it was still entertaining and funny to watch; Adam Sandler does do a decent job as the main character, which makes the movie watchable. I am not going to say to go and rush onto Netflix to watch this, but I will say this an animated musical I would watch at least once, especially for those who were skeptical about it and did not know what to think about it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

The film features a lovable main character, Leo, who resonates with Adam Sandler's best works in terms of emotional depth.\nAlthough its pace is leisurely and its themes more mature, the movie strikes a chord with adult audiences, offering a rich, introspective experience. While it's a family-friendly film, its slower rhythm and profound message might not fully engage children under 10. Teenagers and young adults might find the plot somewhat sappy, potentially alienating the 15-25 age group.\nNevertheless, 'Leo' shines in its ability to weave a narrative that's both engaging and emotionally rich.

This is my personal opinion, but I think that this would be better as just a movie and not a musical. I didn't know it was a musical until we started watching Leo. The singing was great, don't get me wrong. Adam Sandler has a great voice, even when he's a lizard, and the students were nice too. I just think it would do better as a non-musical.

Fortunately, he was unable to make this inconsistent travesty of the original story any worse: it was so bad, so full of preposterous variations on the original, that it would have been impossible to bring it lower. As the movie progresses, scenes increasingly diverge from the original until the beautiful messages Dickens embedded in the story are overwhelmed by pretentious and unnecessary histrionics.

It is, almost word for word, scene for scene, a faithful adaptation of the original book by Dickens.\nThe good? Gorgeous scenery, intriguing camera angles and Scrooge's familiar character arc from curmudgeon to repentant soul trying to get things right.\nThe not so good? The first two ghosts (also played by Carrey) are obnoxiously weird. Christmas Past looks like Jim Carey's smirking head floating incongruously above a wispy phantom torso. And Christmas Present is a jarring, cackling boor, with forced belly laughing at the most bizarre times.\nThis is not a movie for young viewers. From the beginning funeral for Marley, complete with coins on the dead man's eyes, it is (as originally written) a macabre tale filled with terrifying images. The ghost of Marley is horrific.\nMost of the motion capture is mesmerizing, with only a few supporting characters looking flat and poorly animated.\nThe film also cries out for a more inspiring musical score, instead relying on the crazy antics of multiple characters performed by Carrey to move the story along.\nDespite all this, I recommend it as a true book to movie transition, with some beautiful visuals.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

The car-chase with a miniature Scrooge went on for AGES, I mean, Ebenezer is clearly terrified already by the prospect of his imminent demise.

The first and the third spirits were illustrated very well particularly the third spirit. Even though he didn't say a single word he had more impact than the other two spirits combined and it ultimately caused Scrooge's heart. The second spirit almost felt like a transition from the first to the third. He didn't add anything to the story and the only impact he had was that he turned into the third spirit. I get the point of the second spirit but it really felt like he was just there to remind us of what was happening outside of what the other two spirits were doing.\nAll together this is a good story but I felt it kind of tried to be more of a lighthearted story but have a foreboding and haunting feeling but it didn't really succeed in either.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

I find different interpretations of this story to be interesting, and how the tone changes, especially with the eras that these different interpretations are made in. This one, from 2009, probably shaped a lot of kids' childhoods. I don't quite get the ""I'm not sure if this is for kids'' sentiment, because the scary/suspenseful parts are PART of what makes this story what it is. It's part of what changes the main character. Sure, some of the visuals were a little jarring in the scary department, so I guess I won't blame parents if they want to show them the Muppets version or other. Maybe they would rather have a bit older than younger kids to watch it, because it is a pretty important story. But I think those parts, especially with the ghost of Christmas Future, were some really great visuals and shots. I loved how the ghost was never fully shown, just a shadow and a hand, and a lunging jumpscare-esc moment.\nThere's something to be said for the animation, though obviously it's from 2009. I think, though, that there were really good things about it - especially mannerisms and facial expressions. The soaring shots and transitions were pretty seamless, and it was cool to see how expansive the town really felt when you're in the sky. Obviously the animation isn't really up to par with today's standards - it's a little bit weirdly colored, the rendering is strange in places and the faces are a bit uncanny, but it's decent enough. There's not really anything to complain about story-wise, because this story has been told so many times that there's nothing to quite critique - I liked how they went with a darker tone, I think it really drove the character motives better, an interesting take. Overall, a decent enough interpretation of the Dickens novel, maybe not the greatest there ever was - but it's a pretty great take.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

Disappointing. The visuals were great. It was wonderful seeing such life-like rendering in the animation and CGIs but it sits stiffly when the film is about anthropomorphic creatures, which then do not show the supposed feelings they are supposed to be conveying.

Utilizing groundbreaking photorealistic animation, the film brings the African savannah and its inhabitants to life with breathtaking detail and realism, offering a new experience of the iconic story for a modern audience.\nThe voice cast in this rendition brings a fresh perspective to the familiar characters. Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala bring a vibrant energy to their roles, infusing the characters with emotional depth and a sense of maturity. James Earl Jones reprises his role as Mufasa, lending the same regal and wise presence that he brought to the original film.\nChiwetel Ejiofor's portrayal of Scar is noteworthy, delivering a performance that is both menacing and nuanced, differentiating his character from the original while maintaining the essence of the villainous brother. The comedic relief provided by Billy Eichner as Timon and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa is delightful, capturing the spirit of the original characters while adding their unique touch.\nOne of the film's most significant achievements is its groundbreaking animation technology. The animals and environments are rendered with such precision and detail that they blur the line between animation and live-action. This hyper-realistic approach brings a new level of immersion and awe to the film, making it a visual masterpiece.\nThe soundtrack, featuring new renditions of the classic songs and a few new compositions, complements the film beautifully. Hans Zimmer's score is as powerful and moving as ever, and the new interpretations of songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" are both respectful of the originals and refreshingly modern.\nHowever, the film's adherence to photorealism comes at a cost. The emotional expressiveness found in traditional animation is somewhat lost in the pursuit of realism, leading to a disconnect between the characters' emotions and their facial expressions. This sometimes results in a lack of emotional impact in scenes that were more emotionally resonant in the animated version.\nThe narrative stays largely faithful to the original, which is both a strength and a weakness. While it ensures the story remains true to what fans love, it also means the film offers few surprises or deviations, which could be a disappointment for those seeking a new take on the story.\nIn conclusion, the 2019 version of ""The Lion King"" is a remarkable feat of technology and a beautiful tribute to the original film. It captures the essence of the story and its characters while providing a new level of visual splendor. While it may not evoke the same emotional depth as the 1994 animation, it stands on its own as a visually captivating and enjoyable retelling of a classic tale. It earns a solid 8 out of 10 for its technological achievements and its ability to bring a beloved story to life in a whole new way.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

It's true talent, and perhaps eventually once they've done more of the work, they'll be able to find the heart like they used to have. I would've liked to have seen Jeremy Irons reprised his role as Scar, and the new characterisation of the hyenas are drastically different in this adaptation; here they are more dangerous than comedic relief.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad84,tt6105098,The Lion King,Muusving,11 December 2023,4,"I am of the belief that remakes are reserved for movies that in the broad spectrum considered bad. So I was reluctant to watch this movie when it came out even though I, as a kid, hoped to see a live-action version of my favorite animated movie, which is also why this review is 4 years late.\nI was wondering why this movie is almost 30 minuttes longer than the original, and I thought they might expand some before only implied tropes, such as the rules of the land, other characters relationships with the lions, but unfortunately not.\nMany characters that had charisma are totally gone. The hyenas are not comic relief as they were and their dynamic between them is also missing. The voice acting is also bland compared to the original, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are great as Timon and Pumba, and John Oliver also has his moments, though it was hard not to miss Rowan Atkinson.\nThe spectacel of the scenery is stunning, but I still feel it pales compared to the original, such in scenes as the stampede, which seem much smaller and less impactful as well as the opening scene.\nThe music, which to me at least, was by far the originals strong point, is sidelined with mere notes that reminds you of the original. The songs are cut short, such as Scars ""Be prepared"" and ""Can't wait to be king"", and instead we are treated with an original song by Beyoncé, which is good, but not compared to Elton John's songs.\nThe movie also have a very odd tempo. Sometimes we seem to dwell to much on things that could easily just be left to the imagination, and other times we don't dwell enough on what the original was so good at. Now we dwell more on Scars relationship with Sarabi whom he wants as queen, for some reason, and Shenzi, who were just another one of the hyenas, is the leader, though she has no goal or doesn't make any impact on any of the lead characters, and Banzai and Azizi(Ed's replacement), do try but their banter doesn't fit into how we think of hyenas. The original played a lot on the trope that hyenas laugh, so the movie characters constantly make fun of eachother, situations etc. It's unfortunate, since the original was great at balancing horrible sadness with funny moments.\nMany of the voice actors also seem oddly cast. Disney marketed the movie by stating they would try to hire only african-americans for the leads. I know they mean well, but being from a country where English is not the mothertongue means that the will be dubbed regardless plus you can't always hear from a voice where people's ethnicity originates. The only thing that always was the same regardless where you come from was the music, which in the original, I felt celebrates Africa. The African a choir which sang in both Zulu and Swahilli as well as the African tunes were something I believe really stays with a lot of people when they remember the original.\nSo all in all, the best thing about this movie is the things that it copied from the original and didn't try to improve all to much on. For parents I will always recommend the original, not just because of quality, but also due to the tempo and the length of the remake.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad87,tt6105098,The Lion King,thesar-2,14 September 2023,3,"First musical best left on mute.\n(Yes, I meant that and actually did for a minute once. Trust me, this musical remake improves with no volume.)\nAsk pretty much anyone to select their favorites of the 1989-1994 Disney powerhouse megahits (The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King) and chances are they'll answer: The Lion is King and Beauty reins in a close second. I'm the opposite (I loved Aladdin and The Little Mermaid more) and probably one of a few humans who's not gaga over the original Lion King.\nDon't get me wrong. I do LOVE it. The music's great, the voices wonderful - especially and mostly Jeremy Iron's Scar, James Earl Jones' Mufasa and literally every other character, the animation's beautiful, story's a tale as old as time and still holds up and it's pretty darn funny. It's just... compared with either The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or Beauty & the Beast, it's behind in the race.\nNow, for this cash-grab ""live"" action, it just flat, didn't work. While it's GORGEOUS, breathtaking in almost every scene and the animals looked perfect, the voices/emotions just plain did not jibe. Whatsoever. Not to mention the actual voices themselves. Most were just passable, barely memorable.\nI will give credit for Seth Rogen's Pumbaa and Billy Eichner's Timon - both were not bad and were by far, my favorite and only enjoyable characters of the movie. And it's always, always wonderful to have James Earl Jones back as Mufasa. He was definitely a highlight. But...the one that stood out the most was Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar.\nI barely mentioned the awful, boring and bland portrayal of Jafar in 2019's Aladdin in my review for those movies and Jafar wasn't even half as bad as this same year's Scar. Hard not to compare to Jeremy Iron's iconic voice/character, but what a complete letdown. In the 1994 classic, Scar was absolutely incredible and in a jungle of outstanding characters and voices, Jeremy Irons actually elevated the entire movie a few notches. Chiwetel Ejiofor made this 2019 mistake even more forgettable.\nAdd all that to how much the humor fell flat (for the most part; admittedly, I did laugh a couple of times) and how bad the music and musical numbers were, this does mirror the original four: both are in last place.\nBut, hey, at least it was MUCH shorter than the other three ""live"" action remakes. Still over 2 hours, but comparatively speaking, it's welcomed and not as bloated.\n***\nFinal Thoughts: I've never been sure why Scar never killed Simba, himself. He had an amble number of chances, mostly with no witnesses and it's not like they had a CSI: Africa team to figure out who killed Simba.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4d7a783f0cdafc9ad88,tt6105098,The Lion King,Mysterygeneration,6 September 2023,7,"Director Jon Favreau's exciting live-action adaptation of ""The Lion King"" hews closer to the Walt Disney animated masterpiece than any of the studio's subsequent remakes, from the jubilant Zulu chant that opens the movie to the thunderous drumbeat that closes it. Technically, the word ""live action"" is incorrect to describe the film; rather, it should be considered a cover version because it is much more photo-realistic than Favreau's 2016 remake of ""The Jungle Book"" and is just as animated as the 1994 original.\nThe debut of newborn Simba atop Pride Rock and the stunning wildebeest stampede that puts him in jeopardy as a cub are two instances where the film nearly copycats the previous Disney cartoon. Hans Zimmer didn't need to adjust a note for these scenes.\nThe ""Lion King"" sequel's guiding principle may be referred to as the ""Circle of Commerce"" if the original's lesson was one of birth and death and mutual respect, as symbolized by the film's intuitive ""Circle of Life"" motif: This is the latest trend in Disney's attempts to extract new gold from its animated library, following ""Hamlet"" (which academics believe to be a retelling of an earlier Scandinavian epic), ""The Lion King,"" a Broadway musical, and ""The Little Mermaid.""\nFavreau strengthens the 1994 classic by concentrating on improving the appearance of the earlier movie while generally adhering to its directorial decisions and storyline.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9ad89,tt6105098,The Lion King,jakebunker,6 September 2023,3,"Originally rated 5 but its gotten worse since then. This is mainly for 2 reasons:\nFirst and minorly, I think it's quite clear this, like all other live action remakes, is a soulless decision to try to make more money (it made around 2bil!). There were practically no changes to the actual story, it's literally a copy-cat (pun intended)\nSecond, and most importantly, Jon Favreau did a terrible job directing this. And it's sad because I've seen works of his that I enjoy but the decisions in this movie just were not good. The realism in the animation was one of the worst decisions. I feel nothing watching this movie. Why should I care if none of the other characters show they do? Also the Lion King is a musical, a musical that has its own literal Broadway production. The lions are already singing and dancing as is; why is there no expression to match with it? I've done scene by scene comparisons between this and the original and this version has a worse version every time. I have no reason to re-watch this when I'm not getting anything new out of it and the original is much better anyway. Disney better not let Jon Favreau make another live-action remake; give him Mandalorian or Marvel but not this. Don't watch it, it's pointless.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

To say that these subtexts are not included in the narrative is to watch it superficially. The anti-capitalist message is very visible, even in a children's film. These messages can be very controversial because they are in a film aimed at younger audiences. However, it is not something that will somehow influence children to follow some ideology. Those in power will remain in it and increasingly try to increase their wealth to become more powerful over those who are exploited. The characters do not believe they can live a different life, because they are limited to thinking in a different way as a result of the system in which they are inserted. In addition to these subtexts, the animation is good for managing to develop a very fun narrative with very effective comedy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

After the Wallace & Gromit animated shorts, Aardman made its big film debut with this well-developed stop-motion film.

Ginger and Rocky are the best characters in the film, being very different, but who later end up forming a strong bond. Rocky is initially presented as a self-centered rooster who ends up empathizing with Ginger. Meanwhile, Ginger is a determined chicken with a strong character who shows how much she cares about her companions and how much she cares about them. The script knows how to keep the humor and seriousness that exists in the story balanced. It is a film with well-hidden social elements and critiques that make the story interesting to watch. Even the good development of the script and the emotionality make some errors present in the film easy to ignore.

Chicken Run (2000) has a great cast, great animation, and a villain who can be scary or threatening; there are some dark themes in the movie and the way everything looks is amazing how it is animated with lots of details and funny movements.\nThe main chicken named Ginger voiced by Julia Sawalha takes every attempt to try to escape the chicken farm, and she has the dedication to get the rest of the chickens out of the farm to safety away from the terrible owners. The rooster Rocky voiced by Mel Gibson is launched into the chicken farm with the chickens believing he can fly so he can help them escape, with funny moments and a building relationship with Ginger. Also, the other chickens on the farm are weird and funny, with there being other characters who are rats who are getting items for the many plans the chickens use to escape the chicken farm, which is built like a prison.\nThe villains are the owners of the chicken farm with one of them being scary and intimidating, and the other being an idiot seeing the chickens planning something but the intimidating one does not believe him; with their plan of turning the chickens into chicken pies. The stop motion animation is well done with the locations having a lot of details to it, and the characters having many expressions, details, and funny ways they tend to move around, other than using clay for certain things, they also use real objects in a way that is fun to watch when they use them in their plans to escape the farm.\nChicken Run (2000) is a great Aardman stop motion movie that, if you like Aardman, you should give it a watch if you have not already, it is also a good movie to rewatch; it has great stop motion animation, nice characters, funny moments, and an effective villain.

Chicken Run is one of those claymation movies that you have to watch and while I enjoyed it, I wished it was way tighter and more affective than it ended up being. A plate was placed in front of me and I expected one thing, but the taste was not only different but also a bit too bland.\nA chicken farm is run by an evil woman which only focus is on profit. The chickens try to escape and are blessed with hope in the form of a flying rooster.\nWhat this movie does best is its comedy and the characters. All the characters are memorable and lovable, and the villains are fun and interesting. My favorite character and voice performance was Julia Sawalha as the lead Ginger. She brings so much sas and personality to the character, and having a strong and respectable female lead is awesome. She's such a lovable character not just focusing on her own escape but on everyone escaping together that's amazing. Other characters that I loved were the husband to the villain that was lovably dumb, the two rats and Babs the chicken being so oblivious as to what's going on at all time. The comedy is focused on the dialogue, and it works very well here. The visual gags are fine too.\nThe character and actually the entire main focus that made the movie feel worse to me was the male lead Rocky. It's fun how we in this era of filmmaking always had to add a man just so there was one. The entire premise goes from prison escape to having fun and lying, and that's a really annoying premise when the original idea was fun too. Having to escape with everyone before we are all killed, yeah this is a kids' movie by the way. This movie could have been tighter and more focused, instead of being about a romance that doesn't matter and using so much time on a plot tread that goes nowhere. I wish this movie was something different, more like its opening promise and premise.\nI really loved the molded sets and backgrounds, expert the sky that looked a bit too fake. The opening on the mud on the ground and the metal fence looks so real and well done. The overall mouth and fluidity of the animation is amazing and never really seems like it stutters anywhere. The character designs are also really quirky, but don't really speak to me. The Claymation style is something that doesn't really look appealing to me, and it can look a bit ugly in my opinion. It clashes with the amazing prop department to me and makes the chickens look a worse.\nThis movie should have been shorter than it is and with a more simple premise, it can feel long and patted also because we, the audience, know the premise is build on a lie. It is a simple premise with extra steps, and that did not speak to me at all. It also doesn't add to the outcome of the movie at all having the runaround with the male lead, and that just frustrates me.\nBut Chicken Run is still a fun and enjoyable time. It has a lot of character and charm with amazing humor and animation, but to me needed a more compelling plot to really hit home with me.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

We're not saying anything negative about either movie I just wish we had seen the WB movie before this Illumination animation.

Now buster is back along with his crew as they host a show that sees a TV talent scout call them not good enough. This is the final straw for him so he takes his friends on a roadtrip to a las Vegas looking city to prove that they are good enough to a harsh Simon cowle type and his posh daughter porsha. Porsha was a good character so was the cute cat. I liked the edition of the new characters and watching busters lie get bigger makes you wonder what will happen.

As though a good story has to have tragedy, heartbreak, or serious subject matter. Not every story. If this one had one of the main characters die then people will say it's great, but if there's no serious subject matter then it's cheesy, silly, and Eh kids' movie.

However, as someone who only knows Halloween, his idea of Christmas doesn't align with what Christmas really is.\nThe story is told through a set of musical numbers that usually describe the emotional state of Jack Skellington, but also cover other characters like Sally and the rest of the town.\nThe film basically tells us what would happen if Halloween and Christmas collided.

6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9ada0,tt0107688,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Elvis-Del-Valle,19 December 2023,10,"Even though Tim Burton did not direct this film, it is impossible not to think that The Nightmare Before Christmas is his best work. This is a film with a very original idea that has all the elements that characterize Tim Burton's vision. It is a fantastic story with terrifying and charming elements at the same time. The clash between two festive dates that are very different because of how terrifying one is and how joyful the other is. The characters are quite a peculiarity and the one who steals the entire film is definitely Jack. The inhabitants of Halloween Town have all the elements of a Halloween party and Jack is a clear variant of the legendary Jack O' Lantern. Here Jack feels tired of doing the same thing every year and decides to make a change in his routine, trying to spread Christmas cheer to find a new purpose, but without taking into account the imbalance that he can cause. Another character that is also worthy of praise is Sally who is definitely the voice of reason and the love she feels for Jack makes her care about him. The characters are as quirky and unusual in personality and design as they always should be in a Tim Burton story. The stop-motion animation helps a lot with the strangeness that the characters have and that is why it is still something very admirable to see in this film. The production design and art are faithful to Tim Burton's vision in many ways. This is due to his strong participation in the production. The soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman is also another admirable element of the film. The songs are unforgettable and have become somewhat iconic for the Halloween and Christmas seasons. It is ironic that Henry Selick has been overshadowed, since he has been in charge of directing and has done a good job, not forgetting to mention that this was his first feature film. His participation was also important and this experience was what led him to make Coraline years later. It is really curious that this has been a case in which a director has been able to create his greatest masterpiece without the need to direct and only taking care of the rest of the production. All the technical details have Tim Burton's vision and essence, as does the story he created. The Nightmare Before Christmas is definitely the best film in Tim Burton's filmography, one of the best animated films in history and a wonderful classic to enjoy at Halloween and Christmas. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9ada1,tt0107688,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Lejink,11 December 2023,7,"Tim Burton wrote and co-produced this short, musical, stop-animation feature, (it was directed by Henry Slick, but has Burton's fingerprins all over it)) as an antidote to other cuddly seasonal features which are available, cleverly conflating probably his own favourite holiday season Halloween with everybody else's, Christmas.\nThe story's quite simple and straightforward, Halloween Jack (wasn't that a line in a Bowie song?) Skellington (love that spelling!) organises Halloween for his fellow town residents but has lately become bored in the process. To rejuvenate himself, he decides to borrow a few tricks from neighbouring Christmas Town where he thinks a little mix-and-match of the two holidays might succeed. It does seem a bit like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and his adoring girlfriend Sally Finkelstein, who is forever trying to escape the attentions of her creator, Dr Finkelstein, tries to tell him so, but headstrong Jack carries on regardless, his master stroke, or so he thinks, being to kidnap Sandy Claws (his spelling), take his place and dispense much less wholesome toys to all the nice boys and girls. Actually in this day and age, I'm not sure old Jack wasn't onto something considering some of the videogames kids play today.\nAnyway, at least in 1993, he gets it wrong, spoiling every youngster's Christmas morning and at the same time jeopardising Santa himself who he's left in the care of the bad old Boogie Man. Who knows though, maybe Sally can literally pull herself together and help Jack to save the day...\nFor me, the most disappointing feature of the movie was the rather lukewarm soundtrack provided by Danny Elfman. None of the songs stay in the memory although I will concede they do help the story along. I liked two sequences in particular, Jack's disastrous delivery of the kiddies' gifts and the showdown with the Boogie Man. The animation is excellent throughout, recalling for me anyway ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Yellow Submarine"" and even ""H. R. Pufnstuf"". Perhaps I'd have liked a few more good jokes in the dialogue and a little bit darker treatment in the narrative, but on the whole, I'll take Burton's, let's call it a grey Christmas, over ""The Snowman"" any old Christmas Day.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

My Daughter's thoughts were that she expected so much more as it had been recommended and lauded by so many but was left disappointed as the premise was interesting but was ruined by an over abundance of singing. My own thoughts were that the whole Halloweeners trying to understand xmas became pretty repetitive and I lost my interest quite easily as it felt like the same stuff repeated for 73 minutes. It wasnt that Seems we might be being a little petty. But it just didn't feel like a Christmas movie and certainly didn't evoke the same nostalgic feelings that numerous other xmas movies do.

6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9ada3,tt0107688,The Nightmare Before Christmas,TheRetroCritic,6 November 2023,10,"An animated Disney production from 1993 directed by Henry Selick (Coraline, Wendell & Wild), The Nightmare Before Christmas follows ""Pumpkin King"" Jack Skellington's doomed adventures from Halloween Town to Christmas Town and back again.\nBased on a story and characters by Tim Burton, the film is a stop-motion animated musical featuring the singing voice of Danny Elfman, who also wrote the score. While it wasn't a huge hit initially, it soon achieved cult classic status and is seen, to this day, as one of the best animated features of all time. Two holidays are cleverly intertwined here as Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon), a Halloween hero, grows tired of entertaining his usual ghoulish crowd, delivering the same spooky thrills year after year. When he discovers a place called Christmas Town, he becomes enamored with the entire concept and so decides to... take it for himself.\nA loving yet twisted pastiche of classic Rankin/Bass specials, as well as Dr Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas and other classic cartoons, The Nightmare Before Christmas lures you in quick with its delightfully macabre ""This Is Halloween"" tune and it never lets go as Danny Elfman offers catchy song after catchy song, making the most of each one in his own unique style. This may have been Tim Burton's idea, and it may be Henry Selick's masterpiece, but it is, first and foremost, Elfman's baby: his work here is nothing short of genius and deserved a lot more recognition back in the day. From the lonely ""Jack's Lament"" to the bombastic ""What's This?"", the beautiful ""Sally's Song"", the playful ""Making Christmas"" and the devilish ""Oogie Boogie's Song"", the movie never missteps and is singalong-worthy from start to finish.\nThe animation here is, frankly, incredible. This is stop-motion at its best with every shot carefully composed, Tim Burton's art style perfectly captured and the emotions of all these bizarre characters conveyed with great care. The character design is unique, the settings are appropriately gothic and countless inventive techniques are used here to make the animation flow in harmony with the music. The film looks gorgeous, of course, but it also has a timeless, nostalgic feel that'll make you want to watch it for both aforementioned holidays every single year. We care about these characters, feel for them, and can't wait to see them naively attempt the impossible in true Halloween Town style!\nFew animated films manage to get everything right: The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those rarities. Hugely entertaining, a visual treat, a truly fantastic musical and, despite its frightening look, very very funny, not to mention filled with the magic that many Christmas movies promise but so often fail to materialize. It's one hell of a sleigh ride and viewers of all ages should get a big kick out of it.\nEssential holiday romp.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

The story revolves around the Pumpkin King Jack getting tired of doing Halloween year after year, which leads him to Christmas. I feel Jack is pretty relatable.

The edition tends to be repetitive and slow, for an animated musical.

A bigger purpose. He accidentally stumbles across Christmas Town and decides to kidnap Santa Clause in order to usurp his joy of giving.\nThis turns into disaster, so he has to make right.\nThat's it.

Yes, pun intended but I'm so serious here, folks; this was very done and I urge you to give it a fair shot. Elemental is a modern yet fantastical odyssey of romance and self-realization clashing with the weight of ethnic and generational expectations. A colorful and cultural onslaught of imagination, relatability and sentiment, tailored by two endearing leads with irresistible chemistry.\nI'm usually not one for romcoms but if the leads are engaging enough, then I'm sold. Ember and Wade - voiced by fresh talent Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie, respectively - share a captivating journey together, one that isn't just focused on love but puts their humanity in a binding spotlight. Their relationship flows oh-so naturally and is 10x more enchanting than any prince and princess story. You know that scene from WALL-E where the robots dance outside the spaceship? Almost the entirety of Elemental follows that one gorgeous sequence's beat and it's utterly charming.\nThe animation is quite stunning to behold; fluid, expressive and diverse. I can tell Pixar had so much fun with it while pushing the envelope; such a delight to watch. The world drips with inventiveness and attention to detail; I wouldn't pass on living in Element City. I can't leave out Thomas Newman's music, too. This is the composer's fourth collaboration with Pixar (the first since Finding Dory) and his score doesn't disappoint; lovely, often hypnotizing, and always hits the right notes.\nElemental is one of the most soulful and compassionate pictures to come out of Pixar in recent years and it's getting such a bum rap for no good reason. Look, it may seem familiar on the surface but - as expected from the studio that pioneered the art form and tells personal stories - Elemental is built from real relationships and social conflicts and has moving answers to questions on affection, immigration, pressure, sacrifice, and free will. Prepare for some sniffles and tears. I felt the love that was put into it every second and that standing ovation at Cannes was well-earned.\nCongrats, Peter Sohn. Thanks for telling your story.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

Everything was so smart, every element had their own thing, the fire and the air guys were so cool, such a smart design.\nOnto the plot, at first I thought it was typical immigrant story but it's actually supper cute. I really thought they would kill the dad and I was not prepare for that. I really love the relationship of the protagonist with her dad. The only reason I give this one a 9/10 it's because we have seen the ""I don't want to do your thing dad, I want to do my thing"" many, many times. I think we can really move on from that plot and maybe write something new.\nLately Pixar is not doing the best films but this one was really a hit, the kids love it and I hope they keep making great films like this. I would recommend.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

However, while I am no different in drawing comparisons to known races/stereotypes like some demented scavenger hunt, I found it to be more enjoyable to just watch it as is. I follow my daughter's example and just watch it as they would.\nIt really boils down to different people falling in love who come from different cultures and parenting style.

This film is a masterful work that also has an excellent soundtrack made of a very good choice of popular songs from different eras. This story is built through the lives of different characters with a common goal, which is stardom in the world of music. We have the rogue Koala Buster Moon played by the great Matthew McConaughey, who always remains optimistic trying to do the impossible to take his theater to the top. The little pig Rosita who is a responsible mother with a big dream. She is accompanied by the charismatic Gunter voiced by Nick Kroll. Ambitious mouse Mike, played by Seth MacFarlane, who has an excellent jazz voice. The punk porcupine Ash who is voiced by the great Scarlett Johansson, and is one of the best characters in the movie. Taron Egerton playing the gorilla Johnny who doesn't want to be a criminal like his father. Lastly we have Tori Kelly as Meena, the shy elephant whose opportunity to be a singer is limited by her shyness. The film offers magnificent musical moments with excellent animation that can be admired on an artistic and visual level. Sing is one of Illumination's best films and an excellent animated film that pays tribute to the world of music in a worthy way.

Buster Moon, an enthusiastic koala with a passion for theater, runs a once-grand but now struggling theater. He's determined to bring back its former glory, but the theater is facing financial difficulties.\nIn a stroke of inspiration, Buster decides to organize a singing competition called ""Singing Sensation"" to attract a large audience and save the theater from foreclosure. However, a small mishap results in the prize money being mistakenly advertised as way more than what Buster can actually afford.\nDespite the mix-up, a diverse group of talented animals auditions for the competition, each with their unique backgrounds and dreams. Among them are Rosita, an overworked and underappreciated mother of 25 piglets; Johnny, a gorilla torn between his passion for singing and his family's criminal activities; Ash, a rebellious teenage porcupine with a rocky relationship with her boyfriend; Meena, a shy and timid elephant with a powerful voice; and Mike, a smooth-talking mouse with big dreams.\nAs the auditions unfold and rehearsals begin, the contestants face various personal challenges and setbacks. Buster also faces mounting pressure to find a way to raise the prize money before the truth is revealed.\nDespite the obstacles, the contestants work hard and support each other, forming unexpected friendships and discovering their true passions along the way. As the day of the big show approaches, excitement builds, and the theater comes alive with anticipation.\nThe grand finale of ""Singing Sensation"" is a heartwarming and spectacular event that showcases the talents of the lovable characters. Each contestant gives their all, but a series of mishaps and unexpected events threaten to derail the show.\nIn a touching and uplifting climax, the characters come together to save the day, proving that true success is not measured solely by fame or fortune, but by the joy of pursuing one's passion and the support of friends and loved ones.\n""SIng"" is a feel-good movie that celebrates the power of music, the importance of chasing dreams, and the strength of community.

6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9adba,tt3470600,Sing,jamjohnx3,2 May 2023,7,"I saw the original Sing not long after it came out. To me it was Illumination's best effort, not great but avoiding many of the pitfalls of their other movies. I didn't give it much of a critical eye but did enjoy rooting for the characters to achieve their goals, and even gave Buster a free pass for his bankrupt morals. Sing 2 came years later and I wasn't quite as enamored with the sequel despite of it going bigger and louder, and adding some great new characters (what they did to Jimmy Crystal was criminal, he deserves better). I appreciate the generally lowkey character moments and backstories that the sequel sort of abandoned, but the truth for both movies is that Buster Moon is the biggest thorn in this franchise's side. But things started to fall in place for me once I came to accept a theory that isn't wholly original but was solidified by Buster's behavior in the sequel: Buster Moon is a villain protagonist.\nSing is the story of a struggling theater producer and a menagerie of characters that find salvation to their personal struggles through the power of song. Buster Moon finds himself in dire financial straits after a long string of flops at his theater scares his benefactors into pulling out. With the bank on the verge of seizing his crumbling theater, Buster cooks up a last-ditch scheme to save it: put on a singing competition. We are then introduced to a group of hopefuls: Johnny the gorilla is a sensitive soul with a gangster father pulling him into a life of crime, but all he wants to do is sing. Rosita the pig is a housewife that gave up her dream to raise her family, an arc that might be slightly undercut by the fact that she has, no joke, twenty-five kids. Ash the porcupine must find a way to express her true self after decoupling from her unfaithful, gaslighting boyfriend Lance. Meena the elephant has a booming voice but is deeply shy and too afraid to perform when it matters. Mike the mouse is the designated jerk with a velvet voice, a schemer that must discover if singing is his true calling. Gunter the pig talks in a funny voice and dabbles in comic relief. Yeah, that one got the short end of the stick, but at least he has some moments of emotional intelligence.\nBesides the characters' individual struggles, the main conflict arises when the $1000 prize is misprinted as $100k by Buster's bumbling assistant Ms. Crawly. Buster then engages in a house of cards scheme by trying to woo his best friend's rich grandmother, theater legend Nana Noodleman, into fronting the prize money. Along the way, Buster commits a litany of petty crimes and shows a strong aversion to telling the truth before it all blows up in his face in spectacular fashion.\nSing doesn't particularly excel at anything, but it is a comfy movie. The story is unambitious but humble and feels like there was a passion for old Hollywood movies about putting on a show to save a theater or something like that. The music selection is wide and definitely feels like it was trying to appeal to more than just kids. Character designs aren't great, with almost random proportions that make the characters feel like they were designed for a different medium before being haphazardly slapped into a CG feature without much grace or care. Zootopia is much better about designing anthropomorphic animal characters, with a world built to fit them. Sing's world is literally just our world with no regard for the wide amount of shapes and sizes for its population. I'm not sure if this generic setting is a result of Illumination's famously restrained budgets or a complete lack of desire from the creative team to do any world building.\nThe movie flops a bit when it comes to how non-committal it is to its narratives and character arcs. Sing has what I call ""passable in the moment"" writing: It's mostly working when you watch it, but if you think about anything for more than 5 seconds, it just doesn't make any sense. The conflict between Johnny and his dad is the most popular arc in the movie and a prime example. When Johnny's dad rejects him for singing, there's no given reason behind his actions. He just does. And when they reconcile, it comes off as a bit absurd, because why was he against his son singing in the first place? Nobody knows! This really extends to just about anything resembling conflict in this movie. Most problems just... work themselves out. Meena's shy until she isn't. The plot doesn't explore why she's shy or some plan to overcome it... people just tell her to stop being shy until she isn't, then everything works itself out. This movie's threadbare theme of believing in yourself is quite literal, because at no point do any of these characters engage in hard work or intelligent thought when it comes to problem solving. They believe, and then everything just works out.\nSing's biggest weakness is its protagonist. Buster Moon exists in a space of sentimentality and fluff, where morals sorta do but really don't matter. I think protagonists should have flaws, especially in kid-friendly material, because those characters make mistakes, learn from them, and grow into better people. The problem here is that Sing wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to Buster. He does unequivocally terrible things that hurts other characters but never goes through the stage of growth that includes acknowledging what you did wrong, apologizing, making amends, and taking steps to be better - and prospers in spite of this. This isn't a fluke in this movie; Buster's misdeeds continue in Sing 2 when he starts the movie off by defrauding Jimmy Crystal in what was a good faith business deal on Crystal's part. Crystal is one of the few characters to call Buster's bad behavior out and is horribly vilified by the movie in response, despite not doing much of anything villainous for most of the narrative. This is around the time I started to sour on Buster as a character. It feels manipulative that the gorilla disowned by his parent or the elephant struggling with stage fright can't succeed unless the con artist exploiting them does too. A sleazy theater owner taking advantage of a bunch of wide-eyed dreamers would undoubtedly be a villain character in any other story. His happy ending is just given to him on a silver platter - he didn't really earn it, and he learned nothing from the mistakes he made. Not every character needs to be a role model, but Buster is definitely a terrible one.\nDespite its many warts, I feel like Sing is the blueprint for Illumination to make better movies, because it actually tries when it comes to character and narrative. They... don't seem to be following that blueprint, but with a third Sing movie on the horizon, it's never too late to learn. With all the money they rake in, there's no reason not to try to be better beyond pure hubris.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

It presented the lives of different characters that had their own personal problems in their everyday life.

It felt very real!\nThe story was kind of simple, but I liked the way it was told. It also had some decent humor, as well, which made the movie quite entertaining.\nThe animation was fantastic, but so were the actors - and their voices, especially Tori Kelly's (as Meena)!

Many attempts to recapture the turtle magic had fallen flatter than a deflated pizza crust. However, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and the writers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem pleasantly surprised me, delivering the best TMNT content in decades.\nFeaturing actual teenagers as the voice cast adds a pepperoni twist to the turtles, infusing their characters with the energy and idiocy of adolescence. The tangents and teenage spirals perfectly capture that age, earning a ninja nod of approval. The rest of the cast, a deep roster of talent, brings the characters to life with flair.\nDitching the usual focus on the Shredder and the Foot Clan, the film takes a refreshing turn with Ice Cube's Superfly and a rogues' gallery of secondary villains. It's a topping of variety that's been missing in previous TMNT projects.\nThe animation is as unique as a turtle shell, and Mutant Mayhem does for TMNT what Into the Spider-Verse did for Spider-Man, giving it a fresh and visually captivating spin.\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score, like the perfect blend of cheese and tomato sauce, hits all the right notes. Their fusion of acoustic and electronic elements creates a varied soundtrack that complements each scene like the perfect pizza pairing.\nAfter enduring some disappointing Michael Bay-produced films, this reboot was like a pizza delivery in a half shell, exactly what the TMNT franchise needed. Bring on the sequel, and let the turtles keep kicking shell with their newfound freshness!

As a result, the characters and animation are fun, but the story could have been written by an AI. A sequel should take care of that though. In the next movie, we'll have these fun charters already established and the story can go wherever they want to take it, which is exciting!\nSpeaking of the characters, they're super fun and acted by actual teenagers! They're pretty annoying but in a ""teenaged boys having harmless fun"" kinda way which I really vibed with.\nI appreciate the animation isn't the simple 3D Pixar animation we've been seeing for the past 2 decades, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say I thought this was the same studio that made the Spider-Verse movies, turns out they're entirely different and unrelated. I enjoy unique art styles, and they try to separate themselves from the Spider-verse films, but it's obvious that some studio exec said ""I want a movie like the Spider-Verse movies"" and thus we got TMNT Mutant Mayhem. That's not to say the animation is bad or anything, but to me it felt like the movie didn't have an identity. It didn't help having all the pop music needle drops either.\nThis movie will be incredibly dated in just 10 years with all its modern references, but hey it's fun now and that's all that really matters.\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend the movie, but don't hold your breath for anything crazy like the Spider-Verse movies this film was so clearly trying to copy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

In the middle of this, the city is under attack from the criminal mastermind, Superfly (Ice Cube), a giant, sludgy bug who's got the local crime monopoly under his control. Cue a run in with cool, streetwise aspiring reporter April O' Neill (Ayo Edibiri), with whom they strike a deal: they'll let her into their world, in return for positive exposure in the social media world April is fluent with.\nI tend to be fairly loyal, with any franchise with a long established fan base, as it goes through the years, meaning different things to new generations in new incarnations. One that maybe drifted away was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which remained fundamentally aimed at kids, without the dark potential to explore, like with the Batman films. And so Mutant Mayhem, the latest version of the original cartoon, passed me by, especially with 'permanent teenager' Seth Rogan, who I'm no great fan of, being one of the writers and producers. But, I've finally given it a go on streaming...and it's even worse than I thought, for reasons I'd never have thought.\nDirectors Geoff Rowe and Kyle Spears are going with an experimental style with the animation, which may appeal to some, but comes off as crude and garish to those of a certain taste. But what's even worse is how they've mangled the characters and their backstories. Jackie Chan's Splinter has morphed from his original calm, restrained manner, into some funky hipster, who plays them old school hip hop tunes that came out before most of the target demographic were born, and won't remember. To be fair, the Turtles retain their original distinctive characteristics, but what is up with Donatello's voice, sounding like some infant who's just learned to talk?!? No wonder it seems voiceover artist Micah Abbey is the only one too embarrassed to have a publicity headshot.\nCrucially, though, the plot is threadbare, the humour has far more misses than hits, and the whole thing feels like a hideous mangling of the original version, that hints it may be time for the Turtles to put their weapons back in their holsters. *",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

They changed the origin story which might which could have been okay if it was well-written, but that was not the case. Everything seemed so bland and unbelievable. I almost lost it when there was a scene where Splinter was sitting in a couch scrolling through his cell phone like an old man having nothing else to do.

6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9adc2,tt8589698,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,CentralCranium,15 December 2023,5,"Nerd Turtles (2023) is a batch of sensory overload and gross animation. Junk food for the mind. It actually made me feel sick after watching, and I don't know if that's done intentionally.\nI would have nice things to say about TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, but for whatever reason, it just makes me feel awful discussing the fact that I watched it, so without wasting time, here's a hot take on the movie instead:\nI'd probably enjoy this movie a lot more if I were a kid, but being honest, I think even the most die-hard Ninja Turtle fans know this movie didn't live up to their expectations. For one, the style is fitting, but it lacks in delivery for a number of reasons. Some of the character designs are freakishly off-putting for some reason. Not the main turtle designs, but a lot of the others. April O'Neil, at many points, had eye problems. (I'm not sure if I'm the only one who noticed that.)\nAnother problem with making a movie in the same vein as Spider-Verse is that, while TMNT: Mutant Mayhem doesn't directly copy the style verbatim, it does strike me as being a little bit low quality for trying to replicate the personality without understanding why the personality of Spider-Verse worked in the first place. Spider-Verse 1 and 2 may have set a high bar for what could be accomplished with visual aesthetics, but they never sacrificed simplicity. On the other hand, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem tries to do it's own thing, but at the expense of battering the Ninja Turtle source material in order to fit in. There were other problems with the animation outside of this, but I'll give the movie a pass in this area.\nThe writing is so generic, it actually makes me want to cry. There could be so much more done with this franchise, and if they do make a sequel, I'm hoping they learn from what stunk about Mutant Mayhem, because a lot of the writing had its high points and a lot more low points. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the premise, and the ideas stick to the wall, but without spoiling anything, it's clear this movie is made to hype up the next movie and not as its own stand-alone film. This is the ""how do you do, fellow kids"" to the Ninja Turtles franchise.\nI am able to tolerate this movie, I just don't want to think about it anymore. I'll give credit where credit is due and say that it didn't eat me inside, but it just makes me not want to look at another pop culture reference ever again.

The art style was excellent, very unique. There were parts where it looked almost like claymation mixed with illustration or something.\nThis is the first time I've seen the Turtles treated like actual TEENAGERS. I said so to a couple of people who said ""Didn't they always act like Teenagers?"" to which I say NO. They acted like Surfers. They also made an effort to incorporate some more of the comic/cartoon characters that people are less familiar with, which I thought was nice.\nThe movie was not without flaws. First off, there's no Shredder. I get that he's not the only villain, but I was hoping for some Shredder. The soundtrack was mostly fine, but they repeatedly used the song ""Ante Up"" like it was the theme of the movie and that song very flatly glorifies armed robbery. If you're going to gear your movie towards kids, maybe be a little more conscious of the messages you're sending. Also I don't mind the basic changes to April, but why did they shape her like a potato?\nOverall it was an enjoyable enough kids movie for an adult to get through, it had some genuine humor and writing to it which I did not expect.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b3f,,,,,

How easy it would have been to succumb to the temptation to glorify a gigantic genius called Bernstein, illustrate it with music and make a spectacle out of it that everyone would like. Bradley Cooper chose not to do any of that, but to focus on just one aspect of Bernstein's life, namely his relationship with his wife Felicia, whom he loved and with whom he had children, but whom he did not desire. Bradley Cooper makes this Bernstein appear as a person who has faults, who is weak, but who also barely knows how to tame his own genius and whose desperation at having to choose between composing and conducting is made visible without much fuss. Carey Mulligan is a great player, without a doubt. But I miss the nuances of this initially somewhat over-excited woman, who slowly realizes that her husband tends to hang out with men, even though that was the condition of the marriage from the beginning. The moment in which Bernstein conducts the finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 is so cleverly chosen that one could probably write a doctoral thesis on Cooper's motif or on the function that this work, which is nicknamed the ""Resurrection Symphony"", takes on at this point. A remarkable film and an incredibly good piece of work. Cooper's second directorial effort. My goodness, there's a lot more to come.

The acting is good but I didn't feel any chemistry between Cooper and Mulligan, or Cooper and Bomer for that matter. The story line is somewhat choppy; snapshots of high points in Bernstein's life, skipping years at some points. There isn't any character development; there isn't much of a plot. It's almost like watching an old newsreel. I'd rather read an in-depth biography of Bernstein.

Remember how they campaigned for awards, pretending he and Gaga were so in love, give us the Oscar. With this movie, Cooper has completely rewritten the story to fit his oscar attempts, not to enlighten us of Mr. Bernstein's life story. Bernstein's children and associates were justifiably critical of this movir, which is Cooper's cherrypicked vision and not at all a complete depiction of genius stuggles of Mr. Bernstein. Better to watch the PBS biography than waste time with Cooper's rewriting for his own delusuion once again. A bomb at the Box Office and justifiably so. One wishes Cooper could find another ""Las Vegas"" type comedy to redeem his pretentious career. At this rate, he has little chance of redemption with his previous fans.

He's also working alongside cinematographer Matthew Libatique again, who worked with him on A Star Is Born. It wasn't like I expected, mostly regarding almost half of the film was in black and white and also the aspect ratio. I went in almost completely blind with who these two are, maybe not the best thing to do as they move through the events fast in its 129 minutes run time. Maestro begins with an older Bernstein played brilliantly by Bradley Cooper who has his face covered in makeup and prosthetics which makes him look like Leonard Bernstein, the sequence was in color and the next one is in black and white which sees Bradley Cooper in the same role but at a much younger age. Spectacular cinematography. The sound and music in the film is brilliant, making use of the atmos track, and of Bernstein's music in the right way. Where the film shines the most of Cooper's vision is how this is not solely Leonard Bernstein's story but also Felicia Montealegre's, Cooper wrote the film with Josh Singer and these two wrote a brilliant screenplay. It's also worth noting that both Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg produced the film (along with a few others), both were thinking of directing it and would it have been an entirely different film? I don't think so. Bradley Cooper and Martin Scorsese seem to have the same vision for the film and the same work ethic, I think both of these maestros were impressed with the film Cooper created.\nThis love story chronicles the lifelong relationship of conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.\nBradley Cooper nailed the performance and with the help of makeup and prosthetics he ultimately became the character, even getting help from Bernstein's children, what we see on the screen is a magnificent piece of performance which will be remembered as one of the best of his career. The film has him star next to Carey Mulligan and her performance was fantastic, neither are outshining each other, their acting is as impressive and I think the direction Cooper gave her helped immensely as this might be her best performance to date. Another performance worth praising is Matt Bomer as David Oppenheim.\nMaestro was named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute. Is this a great film? Absolutely! It isn't really a great biopic though as I wrote before, they go through his life too quickly and the focus we get is on his wife and music, nothing else really. Yet the majority of scenes are there for these two actors to act out and give us award-worthy performances. I liked the film a lot but I expected it to be grander in scale, yet, this smaller scale and focus on their relationship and the psychology makes it interesting. The cinematography, screenplay, direction and acting is spectacular. I don't think this film has what it takes to win Best Picture though, but other awards, for sure! There's so many brilliant shots, the church sequence is pure cinema, that is what this film is. Not a great story but a film for movie lovers. We get to see who Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre were, their relationship is what the film is about, everything important in Bernstein's life other than her and his music gets sidelined. I never got the feeling the film was too short, it had the perfect length to tell its story, it just didn't feel like the best story to tell of Bernstein's life.

Even the way the movie was filmed, some scenes were shot at a distance through trees where you could hardly see the characters. He was a great conductor, but when characters are on the screen or talking, there's no need to blast the music to the point where you need to turn the subtitles on. Now let's move onto Bradley Cooper. He has a wonderful actor but not in this movie. He overreacted and it showed.

Let's start with the obvious: Cooper's performance.\nLike most of us I know Bernstein from his music and professional life. I don't know what he was like in private. Cooper plays the young Lenny as silly and unserious. Perhaps that's accurate but, for me, it was distracting. But we do have plenty of interviews with Bernstein in later life and for that period, Cooper's performance feels far too much like an impression rather than a portrayal and, dare I say, a bad one. Rather than hearing Bernstein's subtle but still identifiable New York accent, I kept hearing Prince Charles as portrayed in the final season of The Crown.\nThen there was the dialogue, particularly among Felicia and her friends, that sometimes sounded like the pretentious patter satirized in The New Yorker cartoons.\nFinally there was the story choice. It was much more Felicia's than Bernstein's and Mulligan's performance was extraordinary and Oscar worthy. But the focus on his bisexuality and the stress that created on their marriage, while compelling, never really told us how or if that informed his professional life. In that sense, this was a story about the strained marriage of a man who just coincidentally happened to be an incredibly influential composer and conductor. For a movie entitled Maestro, that feels like a horribly missed opportunity.\nI've gone on for too long and now I have to go chain smoke an entire pack of cigarettes.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,

We just get to see it through Zac's character, I think this is one of those movies we're Zac wanted to show he's more than just a pretty face and can act. First I saw of that was Gold. And here, his role looks emotionally and physically draining. Lily James was also really great alongside him and offered some contrast to the movie itself, or his life with his family curse. A ray of sunshine in the movie. Holt McCallany also portrayed the father really well, very despicable. You could say the Jos verstappen of wrestling, probably worse.\nI thought this was gonna be a triumphant story of the greatest wrestling family; but it is also quite tragic. Tough to watch what the family had to go through. And it was great in that way, I wasn't really interested in the wrestling, more like the just the loss this family went through. The movie takes time to build and show case the brotherly love so all the losses hit hard. Didn't really like the ending, made it feel like fantasyland with the brothers. In a movie, based on a true story that felt so real I didn't like that went there, but I think others might.

The Von Erich curse, initially dismissed as superstition, emerges as a tragic force that slowly unravels the family. The film immerses you in each moment, compelling you to experience the characters' journey firsthand.\nSean Durkin delivers a gut-wrenching emotional drama, surpassing expectations of a mere wrestling movie. It's not just a drama within a wrestling backdrop; it's an emotional rollercoaster cleverly presented through the lens of the wrestling world. This film breaks you repeatedly, delivering a finishing blow that leaves you in a puddle of tough-to-watch tragedy yet impossible to look away from.\nThe heartbeat of the narrative is the resonating theme of brotherhood, whether in the ring, playing football, or simply enjoying downtime. The film creates an unparalleled connection to sibling relationships, making it a compelling experience. Amid four wonderfully tragic performances, Jeremy Allen White shines, but Zac Efron's portrayal stands out as his career-best. Efron's physical and emotional transformation captivates, portraying a character that feels small and hopeless, contrasting the stereotypical big, angry wrestler persona.\nWhile pacing issues occasionally surface, they don't diminish the captivating journey. Despite this, 'Iron Claw' marks itself as a strong contender for the best film of 2023 on my list. Experience its reflective nature this holiday season and appreciate the relationships it portrays. 'Iron Claw' is undeniably a fantastic film, a must-watch that leaves a lasting impression. #IronClawFilm #WrestlingDrama #EmotionalRollercoaster.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,

I have to commend the amount of work everyone put in to capturing their real-life counterparts because it pays off tremendously.\nEach of the family members are given a perfect amount of screen time ensuring that audiences can connect with the family as well as understand what wrestling and brotherhood mean to them.\nAs someone who knows little to nothing about the sport of wrestling, I found the rules and stakes easy-to-follow thanks to relationship between Kevin Von Erich and Pam. Just the right amount of time was spent explaining wrestling to people unfamiliar with the sport.\nSimilar to most biopics, The Iron Claw takes liberties with the real story but it's a compelling one nonetheless. Impressive performances, beautiful camerawork, and emotionally heavy themes makes The Iron Claw standout in 2023 and the sports genre as a whole.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,

The casting choices like Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White, breathe life into their characters with impeccable portrayal. Zac Efron's performance is nothing short of remarkable and gives the audience a compelling rendition of Kevin Von Erich. Even the supporting cast, featuring Lily James as Pam and Maura Tierney as Doris Von Erich, delivered stellar performances.\nRare is the film that makes you feel something after walking out of the theater. 10/10, must-see for the year.\nBonus points for a great soundtrack.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,

There were some old epic movies, that could handle 180 minutes, but that's rare. Tarantino has a record of 168 minues in The Hateful Eight, and even that Tarantnios movie took place mostly in a cabin, that movie is not as boring as Oppenheimer. The only good thing is that I watched the movie at home, and not at the cinema.\nLonger is not always better. I felt the same as I did in ""Dark knight rises"" the movie is not geting anywhere.\nAnd this jumping back and forward? Why?

Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a richly complex and entertaining film. The first hour flys by and is compelling as hell. The ""can you hear the music?"" scene is one of the best Nolan's directed, and it's just greatly paced. The second hour is extremely morally challenging as characters question whether or not they should use the bomb. The Trinity Test was incredibly shot and editing, the practical effects are stunning yet terrifying. The third and last hour is probably my favorite part of the film, as it deals with guilt and punishment. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s performances stand out like a sore thumb. And finally the ending is one of the best and most terrifying endings that sticks with you and lingers in your mind for a while after viewing the film. Overall an excellent experience in 70mm and awesome 4K release. Oppenheimer is definitely the best film of the year.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,

The story went ricocheting off in so many directions, some shot in black and white and some in color - most of them boring as if watching paint drying - that I really had no idea what the movie was trying to convey to the audience. And as in Nolan's Interstellar, the overpowering musical score that never let up was more distracting than complimenting. So, onto the Nolan garbage heap goes Oppenheimer, to join Tenet, Interstellar, and Inception. His Batman flicks were OK, but if they were on one of the streaming services that I pay for, I wouldn't bother watching any of them again.

Nolan, known for working without co-writers, wrote and directed Oppenheimer. The movie explores the life of a complex man seen differently by the public and those close to him. With strong acting from Cillian Murphy, less impressive performance by Emily Blunt, an Oscar-worthy role by Robert Downey Jr, and a solid turn by Matt Damon, Oppenheimer's storytelling is unnecessarily complex, jumping between color and black-and-white scenes.

It was especially brilliant fri Cillian Murphy. We are not Americans, so perhaps the removal of Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance (and trial, obviously) is common knowledge to Americans. We were confused as to what was going on though. (I googled it afterward, and now understand.)\nAlso on the plus side were the special effects, costumes and settings.

6595b4d8a783f0cdafc9ade0,tt15398776,Oppenheimer,thedriver829,2 January 2024,9,"Oppenheimer is a movie that, in many ways, should be boring. It's a three hour drama, most of which consists of people sitting in rooms talking. Yet, it is movie that consistently keeps you on the edge of your seat, gripping you from beginning to end.\nIt's no surprise that Christopher Nolan knows how to make a great movie - he's done that many times, and even his lesser works are still commendable. Here, you could make an argument that this movie is his masterpiece. While I wouldn't say that it's my favorite Nolan film (there are at least four other movies of his that I would put ahead of this one), it is certainly an achievement in cinema and a masterclass in doing a lot with only a little.\nWhat do I mean by that last sentence? Well, like I said, this is a three hour drama; there's not a lot of ""action"" in it, and yet it plays with the intensity of an action film. There are various moments shot in IMAX that feel large in scale, yet they're used in council meeting scenes. We never see the actual bombing of Nagasaki or Hiroshima, yet we feel the impact of it throughout the duration of the film. Again, it's taking what seems like little and doing a lot with it.\nVisually, the movie is gorgeous to look at. Hoyte van Hoytema continues to shine as Nolan's cinematographer, showing once again that he is more than just Wally Pfister's replacement. There are many shots, some involving just an array of colors, that really catch your eye. This is complemented by Ludwig Goransson's fantastic score, which is definitely an Oscar contender. There's also the perfect balance of colored film and black-and-white, with the colored portions being from Oppenheimer's perspective and the black-and-white portions being outsider viewpoints of Oppenheimer.\nThis leads to my next praise: this movie creates a perfect character study of J. Robert Oppenheimer, detailing his complicated nature. He's both proud of his accomplishments and haunted by them. He has clear moral dilemmas, and yet he's also a womanizer. It humanizes him without completely slandering him. The movie also does a good job of putting you in his head.\nThe performances here are outstanding. Cillian Murphy gives a grade A performance as Oppenheimer, and no doubt should be in the conversation for Best Actor. Robert Downey Jr. Also does a good job, proving once again that he is more than just ""Iron Man."" There's a slew of other great actors - Matt Damon, Alden Ehrenreich, Josh Hartnett, and Rami Malek - who all give top notch performances here.\nIf there's one complaint I have for the movie, it's how the two main female characters are portrayed in the film. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife and Florence Pugh plays his lover, and neither characters are really given the depth that I feel that they should have had. They hint at aspects of their characters, but don't flesh them out like they should. It's not that Blunt and Pugh didn't do a good job in the movie - they certainly did, but I feel like they could have dug into their characterization a little better.\nOverall, Oppenheimer is a must watch. It's an engaging character study executed like a tense thriller, one that keeps you invested and shocks you with its closing moments. You leave the movie feeling less safe in the world, and yet it's a movie that you long to go back to and experience again. I'm excited to see what Nolan does next.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,

No question.\nWhether the style of a typical Nolan production is appropriate for such a dialogue-heavy film can certainly be debated. However, I have the feeling that Nolan always has to play with jumps in time and also always has to add a vibrating continuous bass soundtrack to his films. Why?\nJust a question by the way: Aren't great directors characterized by the fact that they sometimes vary things, sometimes do something different? I've been wanting this from him for a long time. Now it was definitely time.\nLots of conversations, countless characters, political intrigues, psychological games don't bother me at all. On the contrary, that can make a film quite interesting. Nevertheless, I wanted a little more about the logistical and physical challenges of building the bomb and, above all, more depth on the moral dilemma.\nInstead, the ""Communist hunt"" in the form of interrogations, which for me was soporific, was given too much screen time and thus overshadowed the more important aspects of this story.\nSeriously, I'm no longer interested in this era of American communism-aversion. I no longer find it particularly relevant in this context, or at least not as relevant as other questions about the construction of weapons of mass destruction would be today.\nAt this point the film has missed an opportunity:\nNamely, to be more current than he ultimately is.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,

Chris, what is going on, mate? Why do you feel the need to smother all your films in neverending strings? It baffles me that he keeps doing this. In Tenet it made the movie basically unwatchable (as you couldn't understand half the dialogue), but Tenet was pretty mediocre anyway.\nBut Oppenheimer? This movie is a masterpiece, all but ruined by the ridiculous, grating, incessant music. The movie feels like one long scene because the score never lets up, and the volume is just completely baffling. It's distracting, frustrating and completely unnecessary. Nolan does the same in Dunkirk, and someone needs to tell him to STOP THIS.\nOh yeah, the movie: it's great.

And yet, throughout the film, I couldn't help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied. This film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet I never felt attached to Enzo Ferrari and his struggles.\nThe performances are decent overall. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed by Adam Driver as the titular character. He never showcases the great range that I know he is capable with. His Enzo Ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland. It's not helped that he is speaking English while attempting an Italian accent. If Chernobyl (2019) can get away with all English dialogue, then I feel you can do that here. It would certainly allow Driver to reach greater levels of acting. The saviour of this film is certainly Penélope Cruz. She delivers an excellent performance as Laura and I wish she got more screen time.\nBut if you're here for the racing, the film does delivers. It's few and far between, but the third act is a long, intense race with great sound design and editing. It's a shame that you're not invested in any of the racers since the film doesn't characterise any of them. It means the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as it probably should. It's certainly shocking and brutal but it's hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the CGI is not quite great.\nOverall, Ferrari feels like a film that could've been better. The characters could've been better, the story could've covered a more interesting part of Enzo Ferrari's life and the acting could've been more. I left this film not feeling like I did not know Enzo Ferrari.

The truth is then left between the lines. Some truth must remain, certain historical events and such. Between the lines it seems to me Mr. Ferrari was an obsessed, cruel, selfish man, likely quite charismatic and charming to those around him. We see glimpses of that, the movie has a certain darkness to it, but when viewing as a whole certain scenes just don't work, such as Ferrari at the graveyard talking to his dead son (it feels like something Ferrari would say he does but doesn't, it reeks of inauthenticity in retrospect).

Even though it is based on the Ferrari biography Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine it's not really A Biopic seeing as it covers a few weeks in 1957, Ferrari's romantic and business crises and his preparations for the 1957 Mille Miglia. The Ferrari firm is well into the red, Enzo has to find a new partner, Fiat or Ford but his wife Laura (Penelope Cruz) owns half of the company shares. Getting her to sign them over to him won't be easy especially given his philandering. Cruz puts in a fiery performance even firing a pistol at Enzo. She misses (deliberately?) and the bullet lodges in a wall. They are both grief stricken after the loss of their son Dino, who following a life of ill health died in 1956. Enzo though has another, secret son, Piero (Giuseppe Festinese) by his long term mistress Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley). Laura mustn't find out about this but Lina is pressing Enzo to recognise Piero as his son for his upcoming Confirmation in the Roman Catholic Faith. This thread of the film could have descended into soap or melodrama but strong acting and dialogue prevents this from happening. The main narrative thread relates to the upcoming Mille Miglia road race. Enzo's rivalry with Maserati is literally a blood feud as both of their companies are on the brink of bankruptcy and winning first place in the Mille Miglia will boost car sales. The Mille Miglia is no ordinary race, run along narrow rural roads there is always the risk of colliding with animals, onlookers or ordinary vehicles, This is wonderfully portrayed in the film and we also see how deadly practice runs can be. The racing cars are convincing in design and sound, some really nail-biting scenes, It would take a TV miniseries to adequately cover the life of Enzo Ferrari but this this is a succulent slice of it.

Since there was no early screening of this for Dallas-Ft Worth critics and it hit theaters on Christmas Day, this review is a bit tardy, yet I find myself not caring too much - kind of how I feel about the movie itself. Rossa corsa is the official name of the red color used by Italian automaker Ferrari on their racing cars. Of course, most just refer to it as 'Ferrari red'. It's as distinctive as the familiar roar of Ferrari engines, and director Michael Mann takes advantage of both in his latest film. If only the story were half as interesting as the racing scenes.\nThe original script was written by the late Troy Kennedy Martin, who also wrote the two film versions of THE ITALIAN JOB (1969, 2003). He adapted the 1991 book, ""Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine"" written by the late Brock Yates. Mr. Yates is also (unfortunately) remembered for THE CANNONBALL RUN (1981). Rather than a biopic, the film focuses on a very specific and limited period of time when Enzo Ferrari was staring down trouble in both his personal and professional lives ... ho-hum subjects that draw attention from the spectacular racing scenes.\nAdam Driver stars as Enzo Ferrari, putting to use the Italian accent he worked on for the recent HOUSE OF GUCCI (2021). His wife Laura is played by Penelope Cruz, and his long-time mistress Lina is played by Shailene Woodley. Driver is on screen for much of the film, but it's Cruz who delivers the two or three off-track scenes worth watching. As for Woodley, it's a mystery why she even took the role. Given nothing to sink her acting claws into, we can only hope/assume that something of interest was edited out for time. She is far too talented to be wasted in such a throwaway role.\nWhen one thinks of ""Ferrari"", it's not the icon in sunglasses strutting through life that comes to mind. No, it's the cars. The red cars. And director Mann has built his career by giving us what we want in films such as THE INSIDER (1999), HEAT (1995), and THIEF (1981). The film soars when the cars are on screen. They are works of art and are a sight to behold whether zipping around the practice track or sharp-cornering the city streets of the tragic 1957 Mille Miglia (yes, that horrendous accident actually occurred). Ferrari's financial woes, marital strife, and emotional burden of two sons, never successfully draw us in to his personal drama, leaving much of the movie feeling quite flat. It's the cars that roar, not the people.\nOpened nationally in theaters on December 25, 2023.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,

I liked the underdog sports story where the boys from the working class are pitted against the privileged class.\nRemembering this was the 1930's depression era, we can well imagine the problem of competing against their counterparts who are living off the inherited wealth of their families. By the same token, these young men certainly have the sympathy of the audience. The boys in the boat are also tough and willing to sacrifice themselves for the dream of Olympic grandeur. So the rest of it falls into place.\nThey get mocked by the sports establishment and the well heeled athletes in the sport of rowing. They are committed to putting up with the physical endurance tests, the brutalizing selection process and the possibility they may never achieve their goal. All this is the stuff of success in movie theatres.\nCallum Turner, the leading man, comes from a family living in a tent city. Nevertheless he has the good looks of a star athlete and the love and support of a young woman who is willing to take risks like breaking dorm rules to get some alone time with him.\nOne victory after another and the key support of a boss who opts for talent instead of reputation gets them to the Berlin Olympics of 1936. That in itself is can accomplishment. What follows is a miracle on water that demonstrates the drive, stamina and determination of the rowing crew.\nI knew nothing about this team but now I want to find out more. With the Olympics coming in the summer of 2024 we will hear more about the original team. There are several excellent performers in this movie who contribute to the emotional impact. I found certain parallels with Chariots of Fire from the early 1980's. That show highlighted individuals who suffered from the British class system of 1924 and how they achieved success. It was extremely well put together to show the history and class divisions of postwar Europe.\nThis movie is focused on one team and its success is to show the bond that ties them together and the courage to persevere.

True, it's somewhat predictable with no big surprises. We know the outcome beforehand. But that's ok! The two hours flew by, and the audience applauded.

Joe Rantz and his teammates were of my grandparents generation. I was surprised that responses afterwards all touched on different details.\nMy mom thought the humanity and grit of the depression era was the context of the movie she most enjoyed. That even though so many were poor, there was still prestige in not taking/stealing. That those who were previous competitors turned their support toward the boat. She said George Pocock stole her heart.\nMy brother (who restores vintage buildings) loved how the production crew got the light switches, lockers and the boats all looking so accurate. Who else notices these things? I though he would most like Joyce Rantz's parts in the movie because my brother is a hopeless romantic.\nMy son said he most connected with this movie because of the sporting story. Indeed, he was leaning forward as the race outcomes came down to the business end. He was the one when we were discussing afterwards that kept going quiet but then 2 hours later would say, ""You know when Ulbrickson opened the lockers...""\nI thought the movie caught the spirit of Bobby Moch (coxswain) fairly well. That such a so-called little jockey could push back against a coach as imposing as Coach Ulbrickson to get those boys to pull together-doing his job well! The movie character of my favorite team underdog Joe was well-represented, but of course there was so much to his backstory left out. And Roger Morris was actually mischaracterized, I thought.

While the film boasts commendable period costumes and a resonant soundtrack, it largely adheres to the conventional tropes of sports dramas.\nThe movie's portrayal of rowing is visually appealing, capturing the grace and synchronicity of the sport. However, this technical allure is counterbalanced by a narrative that seldom ventures beyond the expected contours of an underdog tale. Despite its historical backdrop and the unique focus on rowing, the film doesn't leverage these elements to offer a fresh perspective in the genre.\nRegarding performances, the characters, including Joe Rantz played by Callum Turner, didn't resonate with me, leaving me uninvested in their journeys. The film's reliance on montage sequences and motivational speeches, while typical of the genre, does little to elevate the character development or storytelling.\nHaving not read Daniel James Brown's book, I sensed the film might have condensed or oversimplified the narrative, potentially omitting nuanced themes present in the original text.\nUltimately, ""The Boys in the Boat"" fits neatly into the sports drama category but doesn't distinguish itself. It's likely to appeal to viewers who enjoy uncomplicated narratives in this genre but may fall short for those seeking depth and innovation in storytelling and character development.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,

It is not. The film, although beautifully showed the attractiveness of rowing and told the key events well, lacked focus on the struggles of the individual characters. Only Joe Rantz was explored a bit more but each of the 9 main members had to overcome great mental and physical burdens to achieve the success as a team in unison. As a biological sports drama, it lacked more biography, and focused more on sports and drama, which is not terrible, but leaves more to be desired.\nThat being said, I do not regret seeing the film and learn the story of these men winning the Olympic gold. The overall culture and mannerisms, and the financial struggles of the working class people in the pre-WW2 era were portrayed well. The music was a treat to the ears as the team rowed.

Similar to ""Hello Dolly"" and ""Mary Poppins"", these films did not mirror the political and social upheavals of the era, but rather served as a retreat from reality into the realm of fiction. The musical ""West Side Story"" stands out as an exception, being the first to portray the Latino community in New York and delve into their political issues.\n""The Sound of Music"" has been subject to criticism for its portrayal of politics. The film's protagonist, Captain von Trapp, resists Nazism, but his opposition is not rooted in its antisemitism, militarism, or authoritarianism. Rather, his primary concern is the threat Nazi Germany poses to Austrian sovereignty.\nFurthermore, the film has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

From the first second, which has a magnificent entrance to the film, it is a film that has passed into the history of cinema, filled with joy, sometimes sadness, but usually happiness. Andrews, who won acclaim with Mary Poppins, forms a harmonious duo with Plummer, while each of the von Trapp children, who are at the center of the film, are very cute. We see that the magnificent beauty of Salzburg is also crowned as a different character throughout the film. Quality songs that have been expressed musically also attract attention. It never bores a person to listen to it many times. Predictable entry-development-results do not bother at all. In fact, the film shifts to a lot of politics in the last quarter. Let's also remind that it is inspired by real events and characters that have happened. So the von Trapp family is completely real.

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae06,tt0059742,The Sound of Music,stewartb-21209,7 October 2023,8,"When it comes to timeless classics, few films have left as indelible a mark on the world of cinema as ""The Sound of Music."" Released in 1965, this musical masterpiece directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer has enchanted generations with its captivating story, memorable songs, and stunning Austrian landscapes. However, even the most beloved classics can be subject to scrutiny, and in this review, we will explore the notion that ""The Sound of Music"" could potentially be better, examining its strengths, weaknesses, and the possibilities for revitalizing this cherished cinematic gem.\nSet against the backdrop of the beautiful Austrian Alps, ""The Sound of Music"" tells the heartwarming tale of Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young nun who is sent to be the governess for the seven von Trapp children, widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s offspring. The film is a captivating blend of romance, music, and drama, as Maria's free-spirited nature clashes with the Captain's stern demeanor, while they both grapple with their growing affection for one another amidst the looming threat of the Nazi regime.\nOne of the film's undoubted strengths is its memorable music, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. From the iconic opening number, ""The Sound of Music,"" to the touching ""Edelweiss"" and the lively ""Do-Re-Mi,"" the soundtrack is a symphony of melodies that have become a part of our cultural fabric. Julie Andrews' soaring soprano voice and the children's harmonious choruses create moments of sheer auditory bliss that are hard to rival. The musical numbers elevate the film and provide it with a timeless quality that continues to draw audiences to this day.\nThe cast of ""The Sound of Music"" is another asset that has stood the test of time. Julie Andrews is luminous as Maria, exuding warmth and charisma, while Christopher Plummer brings depth and vulnerability to the stoic Captain von Trapp. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their love story remains one of cinema's most enduring romances. The von Trapp children, played by a talented ensemble of young actors, add charm and innocence to the narrative, making their journey from discipline to joy all the more endearing.\nThe film's breathtaking cinematography also deserves acclaim. Robert Wise and his team expertly capture the stunning Austrian landscapes, with sweeping shots of lush green hills, crystal-clear lakes, and majestic mountains. The visuals serve as a visual symphony that complements the musical one, immersing the audience in the story's picturesque world. The contrast between the natural beauty of the surroundings and the encroaching threat of Nazi occupation heightens the film's tension and emotional impact.\nHowever, despite its many strengths, ""The Sound of Music"" is not without its flaws, and it is these areas that warrant a critical reevaluation.\nFirst and foremost, the film's pacing can be a bit uneven. While the musical numbers are undoubtedly the film's highlights, the transitions between these musical sequences and the dramatic moments can feel abrupt and disjointed. The film's nearly three-hour runtime occasionally drags, and some scenes could benefit from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent flow.\nAnother aspect that merits reconsideration is the treatment of certain characters. The portrayal of the von Trapp family's housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and the nuns at the abbey where Maria resides can be seen as somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. These characters, while important to the story, are not given the same depth and development as the main characters, leaving them feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals.\nFurthermore, the film's depiction of the Nazi threat, while undoubtedly a central element of the story, may come across as somewhat sanitized to modern audiences. Given the gravity of the historical context, ""The Sound of Music"" could have delved deeper into the political and moral complexities of the era. While the film does not shy away from the looming danger, a more nuanced exploration of the characters' choices and dilemmas in the face of Nazism could have added depth to the narrative.\nIn addition, some viewers may find fault with the film's idealized portrayal of the von Trapp family's escape from the Nazis. The daring flight over the mountains is undoubtedly a gripping climax, but it also carries a sense of adventure that borders on the fantastical. A more realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by those fleeing the Nazi regime could have made the story even more impactful.\nSo, how could ""The Sound of Music"" be improved? One approach could involve reimagining the film as a limited series, allowing for a more expansive exploration of its characters and historical context. This format would provide the opportunity to delve deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of characters like Captain von Trapp and Maria, as well as to address the broader political landscape of Austria in the late 1930s.\nA longer format would also allow for a more gradual development of the romance between Maria and the Captain, giving their relationship a more authentic and nuanced feel. It could also provide the space to explore the emotional impact of their choices on the von Trapp children and the other characters in the story.\nIn terms of pacing, a series format would alleviate the need to compress the narrative into a three-hour film, allowing for a more natural progression of the story and character arcs. It would also provide an opportunity to delve into the lives and experiences of characters like Frau Schmidt and the nuns, giving them the depth and dimension they deserve.\nIn conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is undeniably a cinematic classic that has earned its place in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Its timeless music, enchanting performances, and stunning visuals continue to captivate new generations. However, a critical reevaluation reveals areas where the film could be improved, particularly in terms of pacing, character development, and historical context.\nOne possible approach to revitalizing this beloved classic is to reimagine it as a limited series, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of its characters and historical backdrop. While ""The Sound of Music"" may never be perfect in the eyes of every viewer, it remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the magic of cinema.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

What I liked best were the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason I like it is Julie Andrews' amazing performance as Maria, a girl who longs for a better life, I think. Maria is beautiful, has a beautiful voice, mixed with nervousness and sadness, all qualities that Andrews brings to her performances. The only film she slightly disappointed was Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as is the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. I can't pick a favorite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? I also thought the kids were sweet and the movie had some clever subplots, like Liesels secret love. 10/10 for a musical, which should be in the top 250.

Directed by Robert Wise, the film provides a perfect blend of music, drama, and romance, all against the stunning backdrop of Austrian landscapes.\nJulie Andrews delivers a powerhouse performance as Maria, a youthful and vivacious nun dispatched from her convent to serve as a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Andrews brings an infectious joy and warmth to her character that makes her immediately likable, making the audience root for her from her first notes in the opening sequence on the mountain to her final scenes. Her character development from an unsure young woman to a strong and loving maternal figure is beautifully portrayed.\nChristopher Plummer complements her perfectly as the stern Captain von Trapp, a widower softened by Maria's charm. His performance is beautifully nuanced; he makes a convincing transition from the distant, disciplinarian father to a man who rediscovers love, joy, and the value of family.\nThe seven von Trapp children, led by Charmian Carr as Liesl, contribute significantly to the charm of the film. Each child is distinct and contributes to the story in their own way, making their performances memorable and integral to the narrative.\nThe film's most unforgettable element is undoubtedly its music. With compositions by Rodgers and Hammerstein, songs like ""The Sound of Music,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" and ""Edelweiss"" are timeless, carrying emotional depth that brings tears to the eyes and a bounce to the step. These songs have become a part of popular culture, highlighting the film's enduring influence.\n""The Sound of Music"" is not just a movie; it's an emotive experience. The plot, based on real events, is engaging, heartwarming, and at times, suspenseful, as the looming threat of the Nazi annexation adds a grim undertone to the film's otherwise cheerful disposition.\nThe cinematography is breathtaking. Every scene is a work of art, with lush Austrian mountains and grandiose architectural structures providing an exquisite setting for the story to unfold.\nDespite its 3-hour runtime, the film never loses its grip on the viewer, a testament to the power of its narrative, performances, music, and direction. Some may argue that the film borders on the edge of sentimentality, but it is this very emotionality that makes ""The Sound of Music"" so compelling and relatable.\nIn conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is a cinematic masterpiece that celebrates the themes of music, love, family, and courage. It remains a timeless classic, an essential watch for film enthusiasts and a must-experience for fans of musical theatre. Its enduring appeal lies in its universal messages and the magical way it brings them to life. This film deserves its place in the annals of film history, a reminder that the hills are still alive with the sound of music.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae0c,tt22041854,Priscilla,TomTalksFilms,3 January 2024,7,"Priscilla is the new Sophia Coppola directed film based on the book Elvis and Me penned by Priscilla Beaulie Presley and Sandra Harmon in 1985. The film is a slow burn that focuses on Priscilla and Elvis's relationship from their first meeting till their eventual divorce.\nAs an Elvis fan one of the big criticisms I've seen of this film is that some people feel it's slanderous towards the Elvis name. I didn't however feel this way, as an Elvis fan I think it's pretty clear that the man was no angel, he had demons and these reared their head more and more as his physical health started to decline. We will never know exactly how much of any of the things you read or watch about Elvis's life actually happened as due to how popular the man was there was so much written about him and a lot of it contradicts each other. Where this film is at it's most unique is that it moves away from focusing on Elvis's career and puts the camera solely on his relationship with Pricilla. Elvis is portrayed by Jacob Elordi who was one of the main stand outs in Saltburn. I've seen a lot of criticism of his performance as Elvis and whilst he doesn't look as much like Elvis as Austin Butler did I think he got the voice down to a tee. Elvis is portrayed here as someone who exercises an immense amount of control over everything in his life. I can certainly understand how a young boy who in a very short period of time went from poverty to becoming the biggest musician on the planet would be in the mindset that the world revolves around him.\nThis in turn has a massive impact on his relationship with Priscilla.\nWhen they first met I believe she was 14 years old and the film and Cailee Spaeny's performance do a great job of showing that innocence and showing how that innocence gets corrupted when she falls in love with this huge megastar and suddenly must grow up very quickly. She's thrown into a world that she doesn't fully understand and pays the price when things aren't going well in Elvis's life. Whilst this film is set 60 years ago at a time where gender rolls were adhered too much more strictly some of the physical violence she had to endure is unforgivable.\nIt is however a sad story all around, a story where no one really wins. Priscilla has to leave a relationship with someone she really loves and her daughter ends up growing up having spent very little time with her father which is made even sadder following Lisa Marie Presley's passing in January of last year. You also have to think that if Elvis had also taken more time away from his career to focus on sorting out the problems in his private life that he may still be with us today.\nSome real food for thought.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

This one is about the gaps in the marital relationship between Elvis and Priscilla and not just about Priscilla alone. It could have been called "" Elvis and Priscilla "" instead. First the negative aspects. Nothing in the movie looks or sound real not the love or emotions or feelings. The narrative is too laid back, the dialogues are uninspiring and nothing dramatic or interesting really happens most of the time. The casting of Jacob Elordi as Elvis doesn't appear to be the best one. For one he is too tall and awkward in his dialogue delivery. For a singer, it is intriguing that he mumbles his way through most of the time. I wonder why he was directed to perform that way. The other characters are also on a low profile too. There is mention colonel at times. It is difficult to imagine an Elvis movie without his songs and this movie is exactly that.( I understand there were issues relating to permission to use.) What is actually the saving grace is the fairly good direction by Sofia Cuppola and the appealing acting of Cailee Spaeny in the title role.

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae0e,tt22041854,Priscilla,alehaf-38127,3 January 2024,7,"Sofia Coppola's 'Priscilla' is an artistic, dark romance showing how much power a man can have over a woman and how it can determine the rest of their life.\nBefore going into this film, I believed this to be the story of Priscilla, not so many mentions of Elvis and the majority of the focus being on his wife. I was wrong as I underestimated how much Elvis was a part of Priscilla's life even from the young age of 14.\nThis film goes over the life of Priscilla from the age of 14 where she is invited over to Elvis' house where Elvis immediately takes interest in her. From there, they grow as a couple despite the age gap, the rise of Elvis and Priscilla. Only for the eventually lead to the fall in their relationship.\nA film about the unknowingness of anyone at a young age, how much power a man can have over a woman if played right, the influence one can have over the other's life. Priscilla's life was Elvis and that speaks for itself.\nSofia Coppola did an amazing job with this film when it comes to the post-script production, from the romanticized visuals, to the artificial look of all things making the sets look like a doll house, all go over the person Elvis wanted Priscilla to be even from the very beginning and also what Coppola wanted this film to be... even from the very beginning. But apart from the visuals and sets, Coppola's work with the actors and camera is very smart especially when it comes to the scenes with Elvis and Priscilla as Coppola captures more of what Priscilla is feeling and puts majority of the focus on her to see what her point of view must've looked like.\nThe screenplay lacks. It is very constant throughout the film as not a lot happens other than the casual bipolarity of Elvis representing a break down in their relationship. The movie would've been better if they captured some other features of Priscilla's life like her karate-era or whatever was happening with her karate teacher. But instead the film was made to be very constant as for the sequences and story development. The character development is there though, but it's not hard to achieve the development of Priscilla from who she was at 14 to the grown woman she was with Elvis.\nThe visuals of this film are probably my favorite part as for the doll-house-like sets, the romanticized look on Elvis' and Priscilla's relationship at first, the framing especially with the change in Priscilla as a character, and more. All make the film so much more of what it is and add a lot to the table when it comes to speaking about the film. What these visual do is give the film the at first build up it needs to show the high point in life for Priscilla only to dramatize the fall, which is just one of the things the visuals do. Another being giving the film that certain vibe which many films need and fail to achieve, but for Priscilla it's like it is its own genre.\nPriscilla definitely deserves a watch and a re-watch as it is that good. Only problem is the screenplay and how boring it was made to be, but the amazing visuals make up for it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

Unforgivable from a woman's perspective.\nAs other mentioned: the height-difference is off-putting since it's pushing the narrative towards an even bigger difference of power as it might have been in reality, almost scratching the topic of abuse.\nI'm sure the real Priscilla had dreams and ambitions and was not the flat and willingless object as she's portraited here.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

The film really portrays Priscilla's own point of view from the beginning of meeting Elvis to the collapse of the relationship. However, it is 1h 52m of repeated events.\nI'm gonna admit it, I'm NOT FULLY convinced of Jacob Elordi as a talented actor. Most of the characters he plays in most of his films and shows are mostly cute and good looking big guys, nothing different each time. Euphoria (2019 - 2025), The Kissing Booth trilogy, and Saltburn (2023). However, his portraying of Elvis in this film is somewhat 'surprisingly' convincing to me. I would say about 60% convincing. But, I felt like having another actor would perhaps made it better for me especially towards the last 52 minutes of the film that is an absolute chaos in my opinion.\nCailee Spaeny as Priscilla proved herself as a talented you g actress that must be given more roles and will definitely steal the show like she did in this film. She gave us that jealous, young girl who is in love with the most famous Rock and Roll singer in history.\nThe film unfortunately takes a turn and loses its balance after the firs hour. It feels rushed and the build on that was happening in the first hour was finished terribly. Fast paced dialogues and events that resulted in actors getting out the worst of them due to the weak script and dialogues.\nI don't have much comments on Sofia Coppola's directing as it was as great as expected. Great representation of the different timelines that we jump to throughout the whole film from production and custom designs and the music score too. At most times we hear romantic songs from the 1960s and 1970s. But, when Priscilla goes through major changes in her relationship with Elvis, the music score shifts to being a modern music score (as if it's very similar to a snythwave) that gives that feeling of being trap and that this relationship will end terribly.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

Because for almost the entire film Sofia Coppola keeps Elvis as a character at a distance. Sometimes this works in the ways it portrays the growing wedge between him and Priscilla but as an audience member it made the character feel lacking for me. The central relationship starts extremely quickly and I never quite felt that the connection Elvis feels with Priscilla was earned. As a result I never really felt like the film got of the real heart of the relationship and I found the portrayal of Elvis to be widely inconsistent and I couldn't quite pin down what Coppola was trying to say about him. Granted I don't know much about Elvis as a person but I don't feel like I should have to do research to better understand a films depiction of a real life figure. I think Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi are great and even if the gradual tension building between them feels like it's missing key scenes they act it out perfectly. I wouldn't say this movie didn't do Priscilla Presley justice but the results did leave me wanting quite a bit. Not a misfire by any means but a film that absolutely falls short of its potential for me.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

I think the movie wants to be a tribute to a young woman who finds independence within herself and breaks away from a life made for her to forge one on her own. But it never really plays that way. Priscilla as presented in this movie isn't a complex or interesting character, and nothing much ever seems at stake. The most disturbing thing about her story, which is that she was essentially groomed beginning at the age of sixteen to be a kept woman, is passed over without much comment.

Its a rough and cold depiction of the life of a man trying to make a name of himself.\nWhat makes this movie is the characters and the acting. Mads Mikkelsen plays Ludvig Kahlen, the main character of this movie. Mads makes a believable character depiction of Ludvig, although we dont really know how Ludvig was, so he couldve been quite different IRL. The rest of the cast performance is mostly good but two characters are misscasts. The guy who plays the priest and the girl who plays the stray girl are really bad actors. Both playing swedish characters. Its not just bad acting, it seems the director wanted to make them look bad. The dialect is of present time(2023) and its like they forget they are suppose to play characters of the past. Im just gonna assume they got their roles through corruption.\nBesides some misscast and poor directing, this movie seem to follow some diversity quota bcs the stray girl is played by a mixed raxe girl looking very middle eastern, thus does not fit the history but probably the movie criteria for casting. Its sad to see the movie industry engaging in politics bcs its rewriting history for political ends.\nThe story is quite simple, Mads character are met with people who tries to ruin his attempt to further himself. It gets bloody at times and its a very harsh and sad story. Not much beauty or warmth in this flic, in fact you will probably leave the theater having a cold.\nIn summary, you wont laugh to this movie and I dont really see why they made it. It doesnt leave you with much but a cold rough stain.

While Danish is similar to German and Norwegian and Swedish (because of the location and how they all became to be), if you are familiar with any of these languages you may pick up things here and there. But otherwise you shall need the English subtitles to survive the film.\nThis does have just over a 2 hour run time, and with some dramas you can feel that drag along. On occasion I felt like it needed a push to get where it needed to go, but then the antagonist would come into the picture and be the utmost vile person and I would just want our hero to go full Hannibal on him. But, that's not who Mads was playing; not that the Captain didn't have his own temperment and skills.\nBe warned there is some violence you wouldn't expect. But all of the romance is very tame.

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae27,tt20561198,Bastarden,BestBenedikt,28 December 2023,7,"That's the overarching question, or rather field of tension, in Nikolaj Arcel's BASTARDEN - a film that offers both beautiful cinematography and a brilliant, subdued performance by Mads Mikkelsen.\nSet in Ancien Régime Denmark, a retired soldier attempts to cultivate the heath of Jutland in the name of King Frederik V for wealth and social advancement - a rather venturous project, not only because of wolves and bandits, but above all the property claims of local landlords. While one particular nobleman insists on his inherent rights, Mads Mikkelsen's protagonist relies on hard work to sustainably secure the rights to the land for himself. It is a case of ethics of merit (Verdienstethik) vs. Ethics of status (Standesethik). This fundamental conflict of modernity ironically seems to be better expressed by the film's international title THE PROMISED LAND than by the Danish one, which emphasizes the protagonist's dubious origins.\nUnfortunately, the film somewhat loses sight of this basic theme as the running time progresses. A brilliant first half is followed by a half-baked second one, increasingly unsure what it is actually about - with echoes of a revenge thriller and even a love story. There is also a sub plot involving an adopted child that superficially tackles themes of exclusion and belonging, which felt a little out of place. Thus, some of the plot lines sort of fizzle out at the end. Given the 18th century setting, there are also some noticeable, though never distracting anachronisms, be it some forms of behavior, the perfect High German spoken by the peasant colonists or certain terms used (the ""German army"" f. E.).\nIn the end, however, Mads Mikkelsen's strong performance, the great direction as well as cinematography almost completely make up for these weaknesses. Arcel crafted a period piece that so confidently ignores the jarring conventions of modern Hollywood that you can't help but admire it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,

Throughout, he meets a lot of resistance working towards his goal.\nI like Mads Mikkelsen as an actor, let me just get that straight out of the way. This guy rarely RARELY makes bad movies.

It has plenty of crude scenes which are designed to shock and amuse, which is fine though ultimately becomes rather predictable.\nGiven that the film is loosely based on the real Jordan Belfort's memoirs it puzzles me that the director would have used Belfort's memoirs to create a film that basically sends the message that ""greed is good"" to the audience.\nThis isn't a film that gives the audience any lessons to be learned as a result of the pursuit of short-term profits which are based on a machismo-style lying and swindling. This is simply a film that tells an amoral story all the way through. There is no central message, apart from the message that it's fun to swindle the general public through dodgy insider trading and exploiting legal loopholes to accrue massive amounts of wealth and status.\nWhile 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is an entertaining film for those who don't want to think about what they are watching. For those who are actually aware of the enduring effects of the 2008 banking crisis, it is ultimately depressing to see a film that has no moral message and falsely elevates sociopathic characters like Belfort into a kind of tragic hero who serves as a kind of twisted Nietzschean role-model to narcissistic people who only care about the pursuit of wealth and status.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,

Jonah Hills performance is probably his best performance of all time. If you don't count, the jumpstreet movies, and the direction of Martin Scorsese feels more modern and feels more alive and with heart, Margot Robbie is another performance stealer because of one ,her good looks and two her acting in this movie was so refreshing, And I don't know that much about the Wall Street business, but from the looks of it, it looks very dangerous, and feels untrustworthy to the point where you have to really pay close attention to what you say and to who you're talking to. The way that he tears his own life apart is so entertaining, not entertaining in a way that I don't feel bad for him, but in a way that the first second and third act felt like a roller coaster and the way he goes about his life overall, this was a stellar performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, and Margot Robbie and in my humble opinion, one of Martin Scorsese's best films 9/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae30,tt0993846,The Wolf of Wall Street,FelixOneDE,21 December 2023,9,"""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, is a tour de force of cinematic storytelling, offering an unflinching and often humorous look at the excesses of the financial world. This film is a rollercoaster ride of ambition, greed, and debauchery, anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio's electrifying performance as Jordan Belfort, the infamous stockbroker whose rise and fall epitomizes the corrupting influence of power and money.\nDiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of phenomenal. He fully embodies the character's charismatic, manic energy, and moral ambiguity, delivering a performance that is both captivating and disturbing. The way DiCaprio navigates through Belfort's highs and lows, from his intoxicating success to his inevitable downfall, is a testament to his range and skill as an actor.\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's loyal yet equally flawed right-hand man. Hill's comedic timing and chemistry with DiCaprio add a dynamic layer to the film, providing both humor and depth to the narrative. Margot Robbie, as Naomi, is a revelation, bringing strength and complexity to a role that could easily have been overshadowed in a less capable actor's hands.\nScorsese's direction is masterful, showcasing his signature style of fast-paced editing, dynamic camera work, and a keen eye for detail. He crafts a world that is both alluring and repulsive, drawing the audience into the seductive glamour of Belfort's lifestyle while never shying away from the darker, more destructive aspects of his actions.\nThe script, written by Terence Winter, is sharp, witty, and engaging. It manages to weave humor and satire into a narrative that also speaks to larger issues of corporate greed and moral bankruptcy. The dialogue is fast-paced and crackles with energy, capturing the frenetic world of Wall Street in the 90s.\n""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is also a technical marvel, with excellent cinematography, editing, and a soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's tone. The use of music, in particular, enhances the film's immersive experience, capturing the spirit of the era and the excesses of Belfort's world.\nWhile the film's explicit content and moral ambiguity might not be to everyone's taste, it's precisely these elements that make ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" a bold and honest portrayal of Belfort's life. It doesn't glorify his actions but instead presents them in all their outrageousness, leaving the judgment to the audience.\nIn summary, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an exhilarating, unapologetic depiction of greed and excess. It's a film that combines outstanding performances, expert direction, and a provocative script to create a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best, earning a well-deserved 9 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,
6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae31,tt0993846,The Wolf of Wall Street,RezaGlobal,18 December 2023,6,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that thrusts viewers into the unapologetic world of excess, greed, and unbridled hedonism. Martin Scorsese, along with Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance, delivers a bold and unflinching portrayal of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street tycoon whose insatiable appetite for wealth leads to both incredible highs and devastating lows.\nDiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of extraordinary. He embodies the charismatic and morally bankrupt character with a level of energy and intensity that is both captivating and repulsive. The actor's chemistry with Jonah Hill, who plays Belfort's eccentric business partner Donnie Azoff, is electric, providing some of the film's most memorable and outrageous moments.\nScorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the excesses of the 1980s and 1990s with a frenetic pace and bold visual style. The film's editing, coupled with Thelma Schoonmaker's expertise, creates a relentless and immersive experience that mirrors the chaos of Belfort's life. The use of voiceover narration and breaking the fourth wall adds a unique layer of storytelling that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.\nWhile ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is undeniably entertaining, it doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of its characters. The film serves as a scathing critique of the unchecked greed and moral decay within the financial world. It forces the audience to confront the consequences of unchecked ambition and the toll it takes on individuals and society.\nThe supporting cast, including Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Matthew McConaughey, all deliver standout performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance. Robbie, in particular, brings depth to her character, providing a strong counterpoint to the male-dominated world of high finance.\nThe film's three-hour runtime may seem daunting, but every minute is packed with energy, humor, and biting social commentary. It's a wild and unapologetic ride that leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection on the excesses of the era and the broader issues of morality and accountability.\nIn conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic spectacle that leaves an indelible mark. Scorsese's direction, coupled with DiCaprio's powerhouse performance, makes it a must-watch for anyone seeking a rollercoaster of emotions, from laughter to discomfort, in a brilliantly crafted narrative. Strap in and brace yourself for a journey into the dark heart of Wall Street.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,

It is obvious that this is an above-average movie that should be watched because it explains money and people so well. When it comes to erotic scenes, which are generally common, we should not exaggerate. After all, that's the man's life, I mean, Jordan Belfort has a terrible life, he spends millions instantly and the two most common things in his life are prostitutes and cocaine. Without these, the movie wouldn't be as it should be. It's not an event movie, it's a movie based on a person, like a biography, and it's limited only to what Jordan did.

I read on this site that it is based on a true story. I read that it is very loosely based on a true story, and a lot of reviewers didn't like that, as a lot of it was embellished and untrue.

Rory Kinnear is excellent as always and some of the other parts are pretty well-played.\nAt its heart is a frustrating but important message - that the top 1% as always look after themselves to the detriment of others and not caring about their impact - whether that be social, financial or environmental.\nBut this is a story about the underdogs, who don't care about the odds, and we all love an underdog.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

He hires a corporate lawyer to help with the banking regulations but faces a challenge as the Regulatory Board's fat cats bring out every dirty trick in the book.

The of Dave and many of the others is quite natural.

The film is based on the real-life experiences of Dave Fishwick, who founded Burnley Savings and Loans Limited in 2013.\nThe film is quite slow-paced and the dialogue can be a bit stilted at times. The supporting cast is a bit uneven, with some actors giving wooden performances, while most of the characters are a bit too sugary-sweet. Basically, the characters are too perfect, with almost everyone being kind and supportive of Dave's dream. This makes it difficult to connect with the characters and feel invested in the story.\nBut the film's biggest problem is its slow pace. The first half of the film is particularly slow, and it takes a while for the story to really get going.

We meet this charitable yet tetchy man in his old age, underplaying the major role he played in rescuing so many Jewish children from the Nazis and death camps, yet deeply regretting the loss of those who never made it.\nThere is a fine supporting cast. The scenes of team work to get the children out between the younger Winton, played by Johnny Flynn and Winton's mother Babi, played by a feisty Helen Bonham-Carter, give energy and urgency. We see where Winton's commitment to help others comes from. It's pleasing to see that there are no uncomfortable Jewish stereotypes. The scene with the Czech rabbi, played by Samuel Finzi, initially torn between removing Jewish children from their parents, yet moving to a position of complete trust in Winton's integrity, reflects the director James Hawes' commitment to authenticity.\nThe That's Life scene in the film does include family of the Czech Kindertransport refugees who were saved by Winton. However, Anthony Hopkins was not told this before filming the sequence. Although I was concerned such a precious TV moment from the past wouldn't ring true, in fact, it had the same power.

Most of us in UK probably know the story of Sir Nicholas Winton and how he organised the transport of 669 Czech Jewish children to relative safety in the UK in the face of the Nazi onslaught in the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. Despite what some suggest, it clearly shows that this is a team effort led by Winton's persistence and determination; it does not make him out to be the sole hero. However, as important as the evacuations is the story about how it came into the British consciousness via the quirky 1970s BBC TV show, 'That's Life.'

He embodies the selflessness effortlessly and brings a heartbreaking sense of defeat, focusing on what he could've done rather than what he achieved.

My hope is that the politicians in Israel look at this scrapbook and learn its lessons as was Nicholas Winton's wish for his legacy to teach rather than preach.\nAlready more than 6,600 Palestinian children that's ten times more than the 660 children Nicholas Winton helped rescue have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Gaza and not forgetting the estimated 535 children killed in the conflict in Ukraine .\nThe movie One Life skilfully directed by James Hawkes is based on the true story of British humanitarian Nicholas Winton .\nThe role of young Nicholas Winton is played by Johnny Flynn who perfectly compliments his older self played by Anthony Hopkins .\nAnthony Hopkins in my opinion is one of the most skilful actors in the business today . Every one of his performances is a masterclass study in understanding empathy and humility rarely does his characterisation seem forced or contrived that can't be said of many actors.\nOne Life is set in two eras 1938 to 1939 during the beginning of World War 11 when the German Army occupied and invaded Czechoslovakia .\nThen nearly 50 years later in 1987 Anthony Hopkins as the elderly Nicholas Winton looks back on his past efforts to help groups of Jewish children in German-occupied Czechoslovakia .\nA humble quiet man not seeking notoriety but wanting his experience to be preserved in an effort to perhaps stop the same events occurring again is thrust into the limelight of a television show with an amazing result.\nWe see how the traumatic events on his arrival in Prague when he first witnesses the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the cruel Nazi regime prompts him to initiate an escape plan for the children of targeted parents in an effort to avoid their obvious fate if left to the mercy of the invading German army.\nWith the help of his colleagues in Prague and his mother Babette Winton played by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter in one of her best supporting roles in years he forms the life saving operation known as\nthe Czech Kindertransport .\nHis mother battles the government bureaucracy back home in an effort to locate foster parents and visas to bring the children to freedom in England while Nicholas Winton and his team in Prague organise transport and try to locate the lists of endangered children from the Jewish authorities after gaining their trust.\nWonderful ensemble supporting performances from Romola Garai, Alex Sharp, Jonathan Pryce, Lena Olin. Tom Glenister, Samantha Spiro and many more bring this emotional heartfelt true story to life on screen.\nIt's so wonderful for this moviegoer to end 2023 with 2 movies in a row that I consider among the best of the year , especially on Sir Anthony Hopkin's 86th Birthday may you be blessed with many more days One at a Time.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,

Ukraine, Gaza etc etc. It's enough to make you lose faith in the human race - or it would be were it not for the occasional story of humanity at its best.\nIn Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, a small group of people (Nicholas Winton is the best known as he was the last survivor of that group) are appalled by the plight of mainly Jewish refugees, and resolve to do something. Despite opposition from governments (German, Dutch, British and American) they manage to evacuate 669 children and provide them with foster families in the UK, where many of their descendants live to this day. A further 200+ children were on a train that was scheduled to leave on the day war was declared. Fewer than a dozen of them were still alive in 1945.\nThen the story was forgotten for more than forty years, until at last Nicholas Winton was given the recognition he deserved (not the least astonishing part of the story is that Robert Maxwell did one decent thing in his life).\nThe film is in two parts; the younger Winton being played by Johnny Flynn, the older by Anthony Hopkins. Both give stand-out performances. Also excellent is Helena Bonham Carter as Winton's mother. The scene where she tells a bureaucrat what she thinks of him is priceless.\nBut the most important aspect of the film is its message. Human kindness is still a force in the world. Everyone can make a difference. No good deed, be it great or small, is ever wasted.\nIf only governments were run by people like Nicholas Winton.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,

Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity.\nThe storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life.\nSure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences.

The acting, the direction, the camera work, the sets and costumes are all top notch. This film kept me interested and engaged throughout, if a bit baffled at the depressingly violent lives that the characters chose to live.\nWe follow the life of a gangster with a voiceover (unnecessary in my view) telling us how young Henry is attracted to the glamour and power of the gangster lifestyle from childhood. It appears to be his only way out of a boring working class life.\nHenry makes his way up the ranks, although he realises that as a non-Italian he will never reach the top. Other than the money and the power it is difficult to understand what it is Henry enjoys about his maffia life. The mobsters live in a claustrophobic, paranoid world, where supposed friends can turn on each other at any moment. Most of the mobsters are obnoxious, violent psychopaths as well as complete morons. They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends.\nHenry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot).\nAll in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living. But then again, once you've entered the world of crime, it is probably very difficult to get out.\nSo, perhaps it was a morality tale: stay away from the world of crime and drugs are bad, m'kay.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

The movie starts with our main character as just a boy narrating how he became a gangster and we follow him through is life. The film has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and looks terrific in 4k, as do so many movies of this era shot on film. The films set design, costumes and props all deserve praise. It's a dark looking movie with a lot of it taking place at night or in these shady bars and houses. We see the twisted values of the mob, a macho world where violence speaks louder than words. The story you can follow but it does occasionally get a bit tricky to keep track of, given the large cast. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for this playing an erratic psychopath, a volcano that can erupt at any moment. This is film with a great deal of anger in it too, all it's characters harbour these terrible emotions. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco deserve lots of praise for their work. The film also shows us the drugs and paranoia the main character descends into. I didn't find the characters all that relatable when they're all essentially villains, but that's the difficulty of making a film like this. The film never really shows the impact the violence has on other characters either, but I suppose everyone is so used to it that they just accept it. The film doesn't do what the untouchables did and give us an important police character we can also follow, the story is seen squarely through the eyes of the gangsters.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,
6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae4b,tt0099685,Goodfellas,Shilo_R_A,23 December 2023,7,"Martin Scorsese is handily one of the most popular and well-known directors out there. Ask every average filmbro and they'll tell you how much they worship the ground this guy walks. As a certified film nerd myself, of course I got to watch some of his films before. They've all been fun overall, and somewhere between pretty solid to good, but I'm yet to fall in love with a Scorsese movie. The most recent Scorsese film that I've reviewed was The Departed, which I've had a good time with but couldn't see it as the masterpiece people claim it is, and I'm pretty sure that I used the same terminology in my review for The Departed as well - yet to make me fall in love with Scorsese's work. I mean, come on, guys, I don't want us to be just friendly faces in the lobby of the building, I want us to be more. *sigh* But jokes aside, let's get into the review.\nOften considered to be Scorsese's defining masterpiece, Goodfellas is based on a book, which, in its turn, describes the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a notorious New-York gangster who started out young. Really young. This movie basically follows his rise and his fall, with a special focus on the relationship he had with two other gangsters - James Conway (Robert De Niro, which is probably the actor most associated with Scorsese) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).\nIf you find this plot description a little vague, well, it's not a coincidence - this film hardly has a coherent, easy to sum-up story. It's more like a timeline, filled with little stories that paint a bigger picture, than a straightforward, classic storyline. It's not completely random structure-wise, of course. Like I said, it's about the rise and fall, and as the movie progresses the small doses of Henry's life that we get are less glamorous, less shiny, and the so-called gangster lifestyle shows its true, bloody colors.\nTalking about bloody colors, one thing that I absolutely love here is the cinematography. Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen, this one's handily the best-directed one. I love the use of red and black as main colors in certain scenes, especially when it becomes sort of hazy and surreal because of it. The famous one-shot scene, the dynamic camerawork and editing, the memorable compositions, everything just comes together to create quite a beautiful result. The cinematography makes this movie feel ALIVE, you know what I mean? One of the best aspects of my experience with it. Scorsese undoubtedly knows his craft, and he works with people who know what they're doing as well.\nThe soundtrack is also pretty cool. It's always the same vibe with Scorsese soundtracks, from my experience so far (dad-rock stuff or classic pop hits from the 1950's), but he always has solid ones. I also enjoyed how he handled a pretty big ensemble of characters with enough attention to each so you can feel how big the mafia is and how it surrounds Henry everywhere he goes, but not so much that it would feel tiresome. It's nice, and rather immersive. Cool stuff.\nI guess that my main issue with this movie is that I wasn't really emotionally invested. This movie is just good enough to be pretty fun while watching, but I never was fully gripped by the plot, never was truly moved or impacted emotionally by watching, except for maybe a few moments here and there. There are some scenes that are iconic and memorable - I like the ""you're a funny guy"" one, the one where a shovel is involved, and the wake-up-darling scenes, but it never passes the threshold, the critical point where it becomes actually powerful. Just pretty good, I guess.\nOne last thing I want to address - I'm having conflicted feelings regarding the way that Henry narrates this film. I feel like it should, on paper, get me more immersed (City of God is my favorite example of a good use of a narrator voiceover), but in reality it just feels a bit...I don't know, flat? It should've had more character, at least, and it was rather dry here compared to how it could've been. It's not bad, and I like the way that some moments are narrated, but something's definitely lacking here.\nGoodfellas is a dynamic, very well-made film. It looks quite fantastic, it has a large cast of characters that it handles really well, it has its fair share of iconic, memorable moments, and it generally tells a pretty good story. I feel like I wasn't emotionally invested enough to truly love this movie, but I do like it overall. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

It is intriguing that Scorsese can redefine the genre once more with another film.\nGoodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill's criminal life, who narrates his own criminal past in a flashback. Henry Hill got drawn into the criminal life as a child and became a gangster. Tutored by Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, he participated in one of the biggest heists of all time, Lufthansa Airlines, at JFK Airport in the seventies. Goodfellas portrays the events leading up to the heist and the aftermath from Henry Hill's perspective.\nThe movie depicts the gangster mentality better than any other film, except maybe Sean Connery's performance in Family Business. Both Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset: if you want something, just take it. Criminals think this way; it's the rest of us who are fools.\nJoe Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito is that of a criminal driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature, and he does terrible things to his peers. And those peers don't forget, as seen in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career-defining role for Pesci, who is a multi-talented actor capable of playing everything from the Home Alone comedies to brutal killers like in Goodfellas or Casino.\nThere is an ongoing debate among Scorsese fans about whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. Without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.\nGoodfellas is a must-see movie for anyone interested in a fascinating look at the criminal mindset.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

Neither the memories of the people whose memories are respected, nor the dead... Isn't it God who created them too? .. But there were those among them who had a conscience, like Oscar Schindler.

An FBI agent makes it his mission to put him behind bars. But Frank not only eludes capture, he revels in the pursuit.'\nThis one was very good. Many call it an underrated Spielberg film and I thought that there was a lot of fun to be had. The film is not perfect however, there are some flaws. In this review I will dive into what worked for me, and the few things that didn't work for me.\nTo begin with that opening scene, I think that this was a directorial choice by Spielberg, that didn't fully work. In the opening scene, you see almost the end of the story, and then cut back. I think that this almost took away from the moment when he was captured, because there was no doubt in our minds that he would be captured. I think that it would have been better if the moment was recontextualised later. However, I did quite like how Spielberg keeps going back to this moment, and we are able to see what these characters think of what they did in the past. Spielberg for the rest of the film is great, giving the film its own unique feel, and creating the perfect level of mystery. We are also introduced to our two leads here, Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. And Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, our detective. Leo really showed himself here, and I think this performance was one of the reasons why he is so famous today. He plays a man who was once so confident, and then turns into scared and acceptance of his capture later on. Tom Hanks is the standout however, he plays such a serious character. He is so focussed on this case that we see it so well, and he proves yet again why he is one of the best in Hollywood.\nThe first act really dives into the set up for the film, as we see why Leo does what he does. There are some great scenes in here, particularly the school scene, that is quite iconic. I think that the two parents, played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye were great. They conveyed such emotion in this film, Walken played a character trying to look so strong, but really is falling apart. I this that this groundwork is so important here, and I am so glad that Spielberg kept in these scenes. One of my issues is that I do not fully buy into Leo's character's motivation. I understand that he feels lost, but I don't fully buy it. I might be missing something, but the running away feels out of nowhere for me. I did enjoy seeing Leo's turn, as we have some montages that were enjoyable. Also, the sets and costumes for the planes and character designs were super great and a special shout out should go to Jeannine Oppewall and Mary Zophres.\nThe second act is when we saw Tom Hanks come in. I think that this makes the film take a great turn for the better, as it creates a cat and mouse feel. Any scene with Hanks in were the standout scenes, and seeing him figure out the mystery was stunning. Out focus was on Leo, and I wish we saw just a bit more of Hanks. One of the standout scenes in here was one where we thought Leo was found, but he works his way out of it in a great way. Leo's story was enjoyable, as we begin to see how this life isn't enjoyable for him. He tries to settle down with Amy Adam's character of Brenda Strong. She was so innocent, and it was so hard to watch as she found out that Leo is actually a fraud. The pacing was really good in here, as when you think it is about to drop, you get a Hanks scene and you are back into it. One scene when Hanks thinks he has found Leo, but actually hasn't and you see Leo leave was so great, and I loved Spielberg's direction in here. One other thing that I would like to mention as I feel like the cinematography could be a bit better. I think that Janusz Kaminski could have done a better job.\nThe third act sees Leo leave it all and fully commit. There was a scene of him really showing his fraud in a university that was fun to watch. We see Leo's capture after this, and it feels great for Hanks to catch him, it was so satisfying\nWe actually see a bond between Hanks and Leo, which I wasn't expecting. It was enjoyable, but I wasn't expecting it. I don't know if it was necessary but it does finish Hanks' arc in a nice way. However, the end point feels a bit generic, and I don't like the text on the screen.\nOverall, this film has a lot of good, particularly the performances, direction, second act and pacing. It has some issues, notably Leo's motivation, a generic ending and I would have liked to see a bit more Hanks in here\nMy score is:\nPlot - 7/10\nFirst Act - 8/10\nSecond Act - 9/10\nThird Act - 7/10\nActing - 9/10\nCharacters - 7/10\nDirection - 8/10\nVisuals - 7/10\nPacing - 8/10\nEntertainment Value - 8/10\nTotal - 78/100.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

The detective obsesses over catching the criminal, even disobeying orders in the process until he finally does it; everyone learns their lesson, and the case is closed, so Catch Me If You Can is not getting any points for originality on my part.\nDespite its lack of innovation, performances by lead actors Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding as per usual. Let's not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr whose brilliant performance earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the Academy Awards. On another note the score is memorable, and the cinematography is good.\nDefinitely not an art-house - as evidenced by the lack of nominations for major awards - but it doesn't have to be.

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae5e,tt0264464,Catch Me If You Can,RezaGlobal,18 December 2023,7,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a thrilling rollercoaster of a film that seamlessly blends crime, drama, and humor. Directed by Steven Spielberg and anchored by standout performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, this true story of a young con artist is a captivating journey from start to finish.\nDiCaprio shines as Frank Abagnale Jr., a master of deception who successfully eludes the authorities by assuming various identities and forging checks. His charisma and quick thinking make him an incredibly engaging character, leaving the audience torn between rooting for him and the FBI agent hot on his trail.\nTom Hanks, as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, provides the perfect foil to DiCaprio's character. The dynamic between the two leads is the heart of the film, delivering moments of tension, camaraderie, and unexpected humor. Hanks brings a gravitas to the role, portraying Hanratty as a determined and sympathetic character whose pursuit becomes more than just a job.\nSpielberg's direction is impeccable, balancing the fast-paced nature of the story with moments of reflection and introspection. The film captures the essence of the 1960s with its stylish cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the era.\nOne of the film's strengths is its ability to navigate between lighthearted comedy and intense drama effortlessly. The humor derived from Frank's audacious cons provides a welcome break from the tension, making ""Catch Me If You Can"" a thoroughly enjoyable and well-rounded experience.\nThe supporting cast, including Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, adds depth to the narrative, contributing to the emotional core of the story. Walken, in particular, delivers a poignant performance as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding layers to the protagonist's character.\n""Catch Me If You Can"" is more than just a cat-and-mouse game; it's a character-driven exploration of identity, family, and the consequences of choices. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat, thanks to its compelling narrative, strong performances, and Spielberg's expert storytelling.\nIn conclusion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a cinematic gem that stands the test of time. It's a riveting tale of wit and charm, skillfully brought to life by a stellar cast and a masterful director. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and catch this enthralling ride.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

More recently, Scott gave us ""House of Gucci"", about the ugly goings-on behind the scenes of the famous fashion house. I had never known about any of this.

He is not a storyteller. And here it shows. It's one thing to adapt some memoir or biography into a feature film; apparently it is another to make it interesting.\nThere is nothing in this film. The story is convoluted; it's unclear who does what and more importantly why. Motivations or character traits are never brought up; almost all of them are motivated by either money or fame. That is hardly compelling.\nThe movie could have woven a smart plot around it. Granted, they the protagonists are acting on base impulses; but they could've hatched brilliant plans and elaborate mind tricks to get there. Nope - their schemes are as straightforward as they come. Everybody's moves are transparent; there is barely any mystery or intrigue.\nIs the movie a pretext to show the backstage of the fashion world, a view on the underbelly of the glamour of the high-fashion world? Defiles and canapés on the one side, cloak and dagger intrigue on the other? Think again, the most boring scene is when Tom Ford is introduced, and still the film treats it as if you're supposed to fall from your seat at that moment.\nMaybe the acting will be the saving grace. Poor story, bad plot, a remarkable memorable performance stands out and moves you in other ways?\nOf course not! Everybody is acting as if they're in a different movie. Pacino and Leto are either trying to outdo each other in some sick game of which Oscar winner can deliver the worst performance, or just phoning it in pure and simple. If it's a bet between them it's actually pretty hilarious and they're both winning. Adam Driver is stiff and wooden and dry. Lady Gaga on the other hand is the only one taking it seriously and giving a genuinely good performance, but it feels completely out of place. To top it all, they all have bad Italian accents.\nIt is a mess of a film and it's not even an interesting mess. It's just boring, it's has the same look and feel and depth as those re-enactment they do sometimes to illustrate documentaries.

6595b4d9a783f0cdafc9ae71,tt5302918,Nyad,MovieKitty11,31 December 2023,6,"This is a laidback style yet somewhat inspirational movie about a woman who is in her 60s suddenly decided to swim across the open ocean between Cuba and Florida to prove herself she could do this despite her age and to reach her long lost dream.\nI'm not sure how exaggerated or accurate the storyline is, but I felt the main contributing factor for her multiple failures to be able to swim between Cuba and Florida was not because of her lack of physical skills, but rather because of her massive egos and how she didn't listen to or respect others inputs. She ended up overcoming this god complex she possessed towards the very end but this main character woman is quite unlikable around 90% of the time in the movie; how she treated people around her so poorly and so disrespectfully, like everyone was beneath her, including her best friend (played by Jodie Foster). It was off-putting the main character thought the world revolved around her to such degree. To me her narcissistic behaviors exhibited and attitudes towards others were just unacceptable. This isn't acceptable for any athlete or aspiring athlete to treat people like this who were trying to help her.\nCertain aspects of the film, what it took to swim being surrounded by poisonous jellyfish or consuming food or taking medications while in the sea or what the mental state of mind she would become due to exhaustion swimming such long distance were quite eye opening and interesting aspects of the movie we don't see everyday.\nOverall an interesting movie worthy of watching and acting was pretty good (though the film itself is not 9 or 10...). Just that the main character was very unlikable and if any athletes are this narcissistic they should not be allowed or welcomed to represent anything let alone women. As a woman I felt embarrassed how she treated everybody around her 90% of the time in the movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,

I would recommend everyone see this as a must-see end of the year movie; it will really get your spirit lifted and remind you of how powerful a dream can really be.\nThis is the kind of movie that makes you feel like you really can get up and reclaim your life and continue a voyage to complete a goal - even if you need to take a pit stop once in a while along the way. It's the kind of movie that renews your faith in possibility and that's something we could all use a lot more of in cinema these days.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,

The story itself is very compelling, so even if the execution is bland, the movie stays fairly engaging anyway.\nThe film's biggest assets are its two main actors, Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, who have a ton of chemistry as life-long friends and the titular swimming phenom and her coach, respectively. Foster especially gives a spunky performance and has the more interesting character, having to balance moral support for her friend's obsessive ambitions with genuine concern for her life, and face the prospect of being an accomplice in her death.\nI obviously wasn't paying attention to the news, because despite this happening not that long ago, I have no recollection of this story.\nGrade: B+",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,

The kind of stubborn person she is, who never gives up and the team that made sure she achieved her goal through the five attempts.\nThis indeed was an inspiring tale of not just one woman but her entire team who stood by her, safeguarding and motivating her, backing her never give up attitude. Annette Bening is aptly cast in the role of Diana Nyad and she perfectly captures the character's various emotions throughout, can even say lived this character which again applies to Jodie Foster playing Bonnie the best friend. The narrative sticks to linear narrative as far as the swimming portions go and giving flashbacks of the past that took a toll on the child yet she ensured it didn't stop her from growing up to be the person she aimed to be.

'The Man who invented Christmas' is based on Charles Dickens writing 'A Christmas Carol'. Unfortunately, as well made as 'The Man who invented Christmas' is, I didn't find it as interesting as 'Finding Neverland'. In fact, I found it rather boring. If it wasn't for the marvelous performance by Dan Stevens, I might have stopped watching.\nDan Stevens stars as writer Charles Dickens. After the success of 'Oliver Twist', he was on top of the world, attending endless balls, dinners, speeches, and parties. However, with his next three books being flops, he was running out of money - and had run out of ideas for another novel.\nWhen he finally came up with an idea for his next book - partly thanks to his new servant girl Tara - he finds it difficult to write with constant interference from his family. With a fast approaching deadline, time is of the essence.\nWhy did I find the movie as boring as I did? Too much talk maybe? Or possibly because the premise didn't interest me? Maybe also because the film was too predictable. I mean, we all know he managed to publish the book. The film depicts his journey from the creation of the main character, Scrooge, to developing and writing the story, and then self-publishing it.\n'The Man who invented Christmas' is a well made film with elements of fantasy, drama and subtle humour. I did enjoy the feel-good ending, but the film as a whole was a tad too boring for my liking. Also note, this is not a Christmas movie - as I thought - and actually has very little to do with Christmas.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b40,,,,,

Every year we watch the Reginald Owen 1938 version, the Alastair Sim version & the George C Scott version. The Man Who Invented Christmas will be added to that list.\nI knew a bit about the life of Dickens; the way this merged his past & present, his reality and his fantasy was very entertaining.

Dan Steven's was wonderful as Charles Dickens, I loved his struggles in bringing the characters to life and the room full of them talking among themselves. Jonathan Pryce was very believable as his Dad, a ne're do well who leads a troubled life while ever hopeful things will be better. He's actually a little bit of a con man and he and Charles aren't on good terms. The stand out actor was Christopher Plummer as Scrooge, a stellar performance as usual. The friend, Justin Edward's, was the glue that held Charles together and always supported him. The story gives us a look into this period in history and the struggles that the poor families faced, especially children who were forced to work in the poor house. Also how many of the wealthy class felt as if you were poor you had no value except to work as their underpaid servants.

It's weird and dark and at times gross, but it was also funny (in a black comedy kind of way) and engaging.\nBarry Keoghan (who we LOVED in The Banshees of Inisherin) plays Oliver Quick who has just arrived at Oxford and is a bit of an outcast. He soon makes friends with Felix Catton (Big Man on Campus) who invites him to spend a summer with his family at their palatial estate (Saltburn). The movie then goes from quirky to downright bizarre as the Catton's reveal themselves to be quite the eccentric clan.\nThere's some rich dialogue in here (like when one character here's of another's suicide and says ""She'd do anything for attention"") and weird situations (like when there's a dead body in the hedge maze - think The Shining but in summertime - but the cops keep getting lost trying to find it).\nAnd the finale, with Quick dancing butt ass naked through Saltburn is the perfect capper. There's nothing like seeing a man's twig and berries flapping in the breeze to make me laugh. I know Keoghan has come out to say that there were no prosthetics involved in this scene which, if true, dispels a myth about Irish men.\nThis is available on Prime and if you're up for something out of the ordinary I'd recommend it.

Fennell's script is witty, provocative, and unpredictable, keeping the audience on edge as Oliver's obsession spirals out of control. The film also explores themes of class, sexuality, identity, and morality, as Oliver manipulates and seduces everyone around him, while hiding his own troubled past.\nThe cast is superb, with Keoghan delivering a captivating and complex performance as Oliver, a character who is both sympathetic and sinister. Elordi is equally impressive as Felix, a charming but troubled young man who is unaware of Oliver's true intentions. Rosamund Pike and Richard E.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9ae8b,tt17351924,Saltburn,YellowManReanimated,2 January 2024,4,"Saltburn\nIf one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then I would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. One should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. For example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...\nI also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of Rosamund Pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. Her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.\nNow onto the problems. Firstly, there are the characters. The fact that none of them, except possibly Pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. There is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between Oliver (Barry Keoghan) and Felix (Jacob Elordi). Now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional Oliver and Felix (as well as the entirety of Felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. There isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between Oliver and Felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. The issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.\nThe general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. Oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. There is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. It is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.\nSome of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. However, I'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. The film was in fact painfully humourless. After all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.\nA word should be spoken on the casting of Barry Keoghan as the film's protagonist. Yes, he was probably miscast. His Liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. Matt Damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: The Talented Mr Ripley. He demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. Keoghan's Oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. However, the casting of Keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. He was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.\nSo, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century Britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. Its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that I shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. Its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? I can't think of any other reason). Thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.\n4/10 (3 points for Rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,

The plot was nice, we didn't see it coming from Oliver, but how did the family not suspect anything? Or anyone? Not even the maids. Cinematography was ok but it didn't give 2006 vibes at all, it's obvious they were trying hard to, but it didn't come out as such. The clothes and the aesthetic were chaotic.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9ae8e,tt26047818,Anyone But You,TomTalksFilms,3 January 2024,5,Anyone but you is a newly released romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney as Bea and Glen Powell as Ben and is directed by Will Gluck.\nBea and Ben just happen to meet eachother by chance in a coffee shop and immediately gain a liking for eachother. They spend an evening together but in the morning due to some crossed wires they go their separate ways with a dislike for eachother. Cut to six months later and Bea's sister happens to be getting married to one of Bens friends and so they find themselves stuck in eachothers way. This initially causes conflict that is until both characters realise it may be advantageous to both of them to pretend to like eachother.\nWhat follows is a mediocre romantic comedy with overall likeable characters but with only a few laughs. Don't get me wrong I know comedy is a really difficult genre as humour is so subjective. I just felt that this film didn't even really try thinking outside the box when it came to its jokes. Yes there's the expected typical sex jokes that always get a light chuckle out of most audiences however it's nothing you haven't heard/seen before.\nThe film to me seemed to try to sell itself on the sole basis of having an attractive cast. It then goes a step further and has its cast appear in various forms of undress throughout the film. Sydney Sweeney almost always has a fair amount of cleavage showing for instance. Don't worry though ladies there's plenty of abs and men's bums too. It all just felt like a distraction though to a story that's about as generic as they come. A nice distraction but a distraction nonetheless.\nJust fine.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,

The two leads had such good chemistry and I think that is what drove me to be so attached to this movie. Much like a Hallmark movie, it was pretty predictable, you knew they were gonna end up together but of course there had to be some type of miscommunication to drive them apart so they could come back together in a super romantic gesture. Stereotypical? Yes. But made it super fun to watch? Also yes. I think it also helped that the two leads are incredibly attractive.

I am fascinated with how they adapted the ""Ado"" in that is ended up not really having anything to do with H+C. It did feel like the Jonathan/Don John part was a little thin and perhaps was at one point more substantial, but to be fair it is one of the least motivated villains in Shakespeare so perhaps that tracks.

Therefore, if you watched the trailer for this movie and were completely uninterested in what you saw, then there's nothing in here that you're going to find engaging. However, if you watched the trailer and felt that it could be a simple fun romantic comedy with no attempted depth or deeper themes, then you're going to find exactly what you're looking for. Your experience is entirely predicted upon how you feel going into the film.\nAs far as the execution goes, it's fine. Perhaps 50 - 60% of the jokes land, the storyline of ""enemies turned lovers"" has been done for ages. And of course, as with all romantic-comedies, the story is completely predictable and fundamentally formulaic.\nThe aspects I felt standout the most is the performances of Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell. Their chemistry is noticeably palpable throughout the movie, and it's their charming charisma and wholesome synergy that carries this film through. I'll be honest, without them, I wouldn't give this movie a second thought. But they really add the star-power necessary to make this film worth while.\nOverall, as stated previously, this movie is exactly how you think it's going to be.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9ae98,tt14230458,Poor Things,Jeremy_Urquhart,3 January 2024,8,"Yorgos Lanthimos is continuing to do a great job of maintaining a singular style while also doing something different with each new film he makes. I don't necessarily agree with the people who say Wes Anderson sticks to his style too much, but if Lanthimos keeps taking further creative risks the way he's been doing, I don't imagine many people will ever accuse him of a such a thing.\nPlot-wise, Poor Things is sort of a coming-of-age story, but in a way that's not only hard to describe, but probably better off not describing. The premise is actually kind of similar to the weird Australian cult classic Bad Boy Bubby: we spend a decent amount of time with someone who l has the appearance of an adult but a mind like that of a child, remains trapped in a single location, and then after about 20-30 minutes, they're let out into the world, with all its surprises, wonders, and horrors. Narratively there are similarities, and both films also have some very let's say graphic content, but visually and tonally, they're pretty different.\nPoor Things might be a tad too long. I at first thought Willem Dafoe's continued presence in the story was hurting the pacing, but I like the direction his character went in, by the end. I think the last 20 minutes hurts the overall film, though. A character emerges who it makes sense should emerge, but they spend a weird amount of time on him and it's mostly a detour before things reach an otherwise satisfying conclusion. That sequence aside, I liked this film a lot. It looks amazing, it's very funny in parts, and Emma Stone is excellent. It also might have my favourite performance Mark Ruffalo's ever given, too.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,

In fact, it takes some time to get used to the ambiance which is nothing short of macabre. And surely, this impression lasts throughout the whole movie; but this feeling of weirdness and incomprehension serves the plot and in this sense, is most welcome. Eventually, there comes a time where, inevitably, and without even realizing it, you are suctioned right in, never to escape again. And you are glad to be trapped in what is essentially pit of limitless pleasure.\nIndeed, one of the things the movie does very well is make you, along with the protagonist, embark on an adventure. Sure, you might have been to the places the protagonist went to, but those are presented in a most wonderful way. The aesthetics are magnificient and otherworldly.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9ae9b,tt14230458,Poor Things,ryandannar,2 January 2024,8,"I find Yorgos Lanthimos to be a fascinating filmmaker, although I must confess that I've not really loved any of his movies. They are usually quite sharp in their social observations, and quite funny in individual moments, but also quite long, and ultimately pitch-black in their finales. Dogtooth, The Lobster, and The Favourite all fit this description, while The Killing of a Sacred Deer is more of a horror film, and a truly chilling one at that.\nPoor Things, then, ranks as Lanthimos's most cheerful and life-affirming movie - even if it's also cheeky, perverse, and sharp enough to cut glass. Furthermore, it's Lanthimos' most technically accomplished film; where his earlier works set their absurdist storylines against neo-realist backdrops, this one is awash in a highly eccentric, fever-dream version of the Steampunk aesthetic -- an alternate-universe version of Victorian Europe, where odd scientific advancements co-exist with weird and colorful twists on that era's fashions and social customs.\nEmma Stone (La La Land) leads this Frankenstein-like tale - (or should that be ""Bride of Frankenstein?"") - in which a deceased woman has been brought back to life with the mind of an infant. This miracle of science has been performed by the hideously disfigured Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). He has named her Bella, and he has paternal feelings for her. She toddles awkwardly, caws in monosyllables, and calls him God.\nBecause he cannot watch Bella constantly, Dr. Baxter hires one of his medical apprentices -- Max McCandles -- to attend to her, and to ""record her progress."" Max is a gentle and naive young man, and this makes him a good match for Bella, for whom Max is the only man she has ever known, besides Godwin.\nAnd so, progress Bella does -- up to a point. But things get complicated when another man enters the picture, and Bella discovers the pull of sexual desire.\nBoy, is this film interested in sexual desire -- the odd comedy of it, the way in which it complicates us, the strange kind of power that it holds, the absurd way in which it undercuts our most evolved notions about ourselves. Neither Lanthimos nor his actors are shy about this aspect of the film, and although I wouldn't exactly call the movie ""titillating"" -- as its many sex-scenes feel more satirical than sexy -- there's plenty here to make a Puritan blush. If you couple the notion of Bella's sexual awakening with the notion that she is LITERALLY a 5 or 6-year-old in a grown woman's body, there emerge some very icky undertones that the film is very aware of.\nThis leads to my one major misgiving about this film, which is the fact that much of its comedy co-exists with some pretty queasy undercurrents. The film's awareness of this won't excuse it for all viewers -- but, as one character humorously observes: ""All sexuality is immoral.""\nAnd ultimately, there is much more to this film than I've yet described. Bella's hunger for worldly experience leads her to philosophy and social-causes, just as readily as it leads her toward other men, and toward the realization that many of those who claim to love her simply want to exert ownership over her.\nThe basic storyline of this film has much in common with Pygmalion, the George Bernard Shaw play which was later remade as a musical, ""My Fair Lady."" All are stories about women who are ""made by"" men -- men who are then spurned when they realize they cannot own what they feel they have created. But Lanthimos and his crew made this story resonate, for me, much more than those earlier versions of this tale ever did. And it must be said, the kind of imagination and technical wizardry that they brought to the visuals -- and to the idiosyncratic use of music, which I could write a separate essay about -- really breathed the stuff of life into this telling.\nOf course, Emma Stone's performance as Bella deserves special mention. The film required a certain special magic to make this character work. At its worst, a character like Bella might have come across as another groan-inducing portrait of a mentally-disabled person by a non-disabled actor. But Stone locates a real sense of childlike wonder and chaos within Bella in those early scenes. In the way she walks, in her strange shifts of mood, her sudden outbursts of violence followed by giggles, we do get a very real sense of what it might be like to be a toddler coming to grips with a grown woman's body.\nAs Bella learns and matures through her experiences, the way Stone modulates her performance, and gradually refines her body-language and manner of speech -- well, it's so subtle you almost don't notice, until suddenly you realize that Bella has been speaking full and intelligent sentences for awhile, and that she no longer walks like a toddler, and you can't quite recall the moment where that transition happened.\nBy the ending of the film, Bella has become an incredibly unique and memorable character, and much unlikely poetry (and stinging comedy) has been revealed through her journey.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,

Leaving the theatre, I was reminded of how I felt when I saw Everything Everywhere All at Once, another highly unusual film which became the darling of film critics everywhere. In both cases I kept asking myself ""what did I just watch??"". Poor Things is inventive, stylish, well acted, but most of all, highly sexualized. Unfortunately it is also repetitive, too long, and a little too bizarre at times. The film asks a lot from its audience- from accepting the Frankenstein premise, to stomaching deliberate shots of corpses and internal organs, and to revel in the heroine's sexual episodes as they seem key to her journey of self discovery. But the biggest fault lies with Emma Stone's character. The strong sympathy you feel in the first half of the film when she is a pitiful ""child"" turns to apathy as her character ""matures"" into an annoying, self centered woman. They were aiming for strong and independent, but she just isn't likable enough for the viewer to be emotionally invested by the time the movie ends.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9ae9e,tt14230458,Poor Things,elicopperman,2 January 2024,9,"As of the most critically acclaimed movies released last year, Yorgos Lanthimos' adaptation of Alasdair Grey's darkly comedic novel Poor Things has been a top contender. Starring the likes of Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, etc, the film has been regarded as one of the finest cinematic achievements in 2023 and the winner of the Golden Lion at the most recent Venice Film Festival. So with a lot of talent onboard this strange project, it's time to kickstart the new year with a look back at one of the top choices for recommendation as far as last year is concerned.\nThe film focuses on a young Victorian woman named Bella Baxter, who was crudely resurrected by scientific surgeon Godwin Baxter following an attempted suicide. By means of discovering who she is internally and externally, Bella runs off with a debauched lawyer and experiences the world through a new lens. As this film could be seen as a modernized Frankenstein narrative with personal introspection, Poor Things is ultimately carried by Bella's ongoing mental development. While the film's commentary on female empowerment triumphing over sexual pleasure may be a bit misguided, it's through her own growth as a resurrected soul that makes Bella as sympathetic as she is irritating. Tony McNamara's dialogue heavy screenplay is lifted thanks in part to Emma Stone portraying Bella as simultaneously emotional and robotic, almost like we're seeing the human embodiment of AI figuring themselves out in a world that's foreign to them. It has a lot of dark comedy sprinkled throughout its runtime, but this tale of self reflection from reincarnation remains unique for all the right reasons.\nAlongside Stone, the cast embrace their roles with raw passion and over the top pseudo realism, at least when they have proper screen time. While Godwin and his assistant Max McCandles care a lot about Bella in spite of their refusal for her to live a life of free will based on fear, they often don't leave as much of an impact as the people Bella breaks mentally. The biggest example would be lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, whose cunning affection towards Bella gets trampled by her constant switches from sex craved to intellectual babble, and Mark Ruffalo captures the character's worsening mental state to such a delightfully pitiful degree. Other than those few, most of the remaining cast merely come up whenever the story calls for Bella to experience different perspectives, and yet even the smallest role could make a strong impression, from bored socialites to empathetic prostitutes. With such a diverse range of fascinating characters for the main protagonist to learn from, any viewer may walk away with at least one notable player worth remembering for their eccentricities alone.\nNow admittedly, some of the filmmaking qualities feel fairly mixed in the long run. On one hand, the set and costume design are gorgeously detailed and crafted with such splendor that anyplace Bella goes through feels like a surreal dream anyone can step into. That being said, the decision to execute much of the third act in black & white would have been more impactful if the film still kept certain scenes throughout transitioning from monochrome to saturated, since the change feels a bit too abrupt for its own good. Also, as impressive as the visual effects are in depicting so many different scientific creatures, some shots with a noticeably garish color scheme feel out of place in what is ultimately a comedically grim feature. However, perhaps the film;s finest achievement in embracing its frightening atmosphere is the score by Jerskin Fendrix, which gets so spine tingling and nerve wracking that even the most unphased viewer could feel turned off. Some of the production values may work better than others, but they still remind us that we're in a surreal sci fi fantasy unlike any other.\nAs internally self reflective as it is wildly imaginative, Poor Things is one of the finest works of Yorgos Lanthimos' career. Its bizarre nature may not be up everyone's alley, but since this film is still playing in theaters as of now, it truly must be seen in order to be believed. What seems like a weird take on examining one's life is far more outrageous and fascinating than meets the eye, and here's hoping that the film will be a top contender once the primary American award shows come about.

While there might be some likable elements in each story, it's a written mess carried by its actors, whom you might only watch because you appreciate their work outside of this film. They deliver an okay performance, but the lack of substantial material limits their impact. For a film exploring different types and ways of love, every story feels incredibly shallow, featuring characters making stupid decisions without much payoff. Despite being a Christmas film with entertaining actors, the overall lack of meaningful events may leave you questioning whether it was worth watching.

""Love, actually"" is a very British comedy about love on Christmas, and the magic of Christmas and the spirit of Christmas. It's a really clever idea of having many small and completely different stories being the focus of this movie because love comes in different kinds. The clever thing is that somehow all these stories do interact woth each other but each and every one of them serves its own purpose. Emma Thompson I think speaks to the hearts of many women around the globe, and her performance is very poignant and raw and real. Hugh Grant's story is here to remind us of Clinton and Lewinsky. And Keira Knightley of course steals the hearts of many once again. Some very iconic scenes, some great pop-culture moments and a ridiculous song and performance by a great Bill Nighy.

Maybe it is sharing sweet and romantic moments together? Or maybe it is unbridled faithfulness and devotion over time? This movie explores all of these aspects of love and more.\nInterwoven within this movie are stories of people from all walks of life from the young to the old. Each person explores a facet of love like a diamond glistening brightly reflecting its light and beauty in various different ways. E.g. We see those pure moments where time seemingly slows down as a person is enraptured by someone else for the first time. We also see how power can influence and potentially corrupt the dynamic of people in romantic relationships e.g. Superiors and subordinates. The film showcases the joy of couples getting married whilst also showing the sorrows of unrequited love. The film also examines the themes of dating, casual relationships, and temptation in the face of faithfulness.\nLove Actually is an enjoyable film that is funny, lighthearted, sentimental, and romantic. It will appeal to people of all ages who want to experience vicariously what it means to be in love. This film will surely bring you and your loved one into a romantic mood by the end. It is an instant classic rom-com and well worth the watch! Highly recommended!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,
6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aea8,tt0314331,Love Actually,colethecook,28 December 2023,2,"Love Actually, a film that has garnered praise for its star-studded cast and holiday charm, presents a mixed bag of emotions for viewers seeking a fresh take on romance. While the ensemble cast brings familiar faces to the screen, the movie's reliance on well-worn romantic clichés and its struggle to provide depth to its characters raise questions about its lasting impact.\nOne of the noticeable aspects of Love Actually is its abundant use of romantic tropes. From the shy confessions of unspoken love to the grand gestures that seem to conveniently unfold, the film embraces these clichés with open arms. While some may argue that familiarity is part of the charm, it leaves others, like myself, wanting more substance and originality. The predictability of the plotlines undermines the potential for genuine surprises and emotional resonance.\nThe ensemble cast, featuring notable actors such as Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth, is undoubtedly one of the film's selling points. However, the star power fails to translate into compelling characters. The individuals portrayed often lack the depth needed to make their romantic journeys truly engaging. It becomes a parade of famous faces navigating through storylines that, despite their potential, feel one-dimensional and fail to establish a meaningful connection with the audience.\nLove Actually attempts to explore the multifaceted nature of love by intertwining various storylines. Yet, this ambitious approach results in pacing issues that hinder the overall viewing experience. The transitions between scenes can feel abrupt, making it challenging for viewers to fully immerse themselves in the unfolding narratives. As a result, the film struggles to build and sustain emotional intensity, leaving moments that should resonate feeling disconnected.\nWhile the film aims to capture the complexity of love, certain relationships portrayed in Love Actually border on the improbable. From workplace romances that seem far-fetched to connections between characters that lack authenticity, the film's exploration of love often ventures into the realm of fantasy rather than genuine human experience. This contributes to a sense of detachment from the characters and their romantic entanglements.\nPacing is a recurring issue in Love Actually, and it reflects the film's attempt to balance a multitude of storylines. The constant shift between characters and scenarios prevents the audience from fully investing in any particular narrative. The lack of a cohesive rhythm undermines the impact of individual moments, leaving the viewer with a fragmented sense of the overall story.\nIn addition to pacing concerns, Love Actually faces criticism for its occasional missteps in portraying relationships. Some character dynamics perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce gender norms, raising questions about the film's cultural sensitivity. While the intent may be lighthearted, these elements detract from the authenticity the film aims to capture.\nIn conclusion, Love Actually, with its star-studded ensemble and holiday charm, falls short of expectations due to its reliance on romantic clichés, pacing issues, and occasional problematic portrayals of relationships. While it has its moments of levity and charm, the overall experience is hindered by a lack of originality and depth. For those seeking a fresh take on romance, Love Actually may leave you wanting, as it navigates the terrain of well-trodden clichés without breaking new ground.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,

I mean, they chucked in a boatload of big-name actors, thinking that's all it takes to make a killer rom-com, but nah, it's like they just threw a bunch of random love stories into a blender and hoped for the best.\nFirst off, the plot is all over the place. You've got like, what, a million different stories going on? It's like the filmmakers couldn't decide on one good story, so they just went, ""Ah, let's do 'em all!"" The result? A confusing mishmash that's hard to follow. You barely get to know one couple, and whoosh, it's onto the next.\nThe characters, man, they're like cardboard cutouts. There's little depth, and most of 'em are walking clichés. You've got your typical lovesick puppy, the guy who's pining for his best mate's wife (creepy, much?), and don't get me started on the whole American girls falling for the bumbling Brit thing. It's like they picked the most stereotypical traits and ran with it.\nAnd the humor? It tries way too hard. Some of the jokes are just cringey. It's like, we get it, you're trying to be funny and quirky, but it falls flat most of the time. Feels like they're trying to shove the laughs down your throat.\nThe thing about ""Love Actually"" is, it's trying to sell this fairy-tale version of love, but it's so out of touch. It's like a bunch of unrealistic, soppy stories mashed together. And don't get me started on how it handles serious stuff like cheating. It's all glossed over with a cutesy bow.\nVisually, it's nothing special either. The whole thing just screams average. Sure, there are a couple of catchy songs, but that's not enough to save this trainwreck.\nSo, in a nutshell, ""Love Actually"" is a hot mess. It's trying to be this big, warm-fuzzy, feel-good movie, but it's more like a cheesy, try-hard flick that's bitten off more than it can chew.

And I have to say it's a fun, endearing, silly and a few touchingly sad moments that make for an enjoyable, if somewhat long, movie well worth seeing.\nEach of the individual storylines moved a long quickly with some being better developed than others. The best developed plot was the one involving Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. The Hugh Grant one was silly yet fun. Liam Neeson and the kid from so many movies and TV shows back then was good. The Keira Knightley one was poignant yet unbelievable. The Colin Firth one was also unbelievable yet was so sappy and heartwarming. The whole Bill Nighy aging rocker plot line was a hoot. And the two storylines about the movie stand ins and the chav going to America were cute yet forgettable. Best of all was the one about Laura Linney's distant longing for a colleague that eventually comes to pass, yet not as might have been imagined. That one will stick with me as so touching.\nAddendum 12/26/23. Reading various reviews and critiques of Love Actually, many are trashing it for being superficial and misogynistic. And yes, there are elements of both in a number of the storylines. The Knightley-Lincoln one was the worst for this, especially with the creepy wedding video. Yet, I found the two best storylines and also the most heartfelt to be those with Emma Thompson and Laura Linney. The first a mother f two young children dealing with a straying husband. The second a single woman trying to start a relationship while also dealing with family issues. Could both characters have been more 'empowered'? Of course.

It's time to watch the same 5 movies as always because tradition, but let me be honest, I might skip this one next year.\nHome Alone is a concept that screams Chris Columbus, since it's an amazing child fantasy. He has always been the master of that, creating the scenarios that speak to an inner child in you, imagining that you, in this case, were home alone owning the house, doing whatever you wanted. But after rewatching it for the millionth time, the magic has worn off, as per usual when it comes to me and Columbus movies. Maybe it's me seeing more and more small things I don't like, and repeatedly seeing them just makes me want to skip to the best parts of the movie. This is still a movie I hold dear but for the future, it can run in the background.\nKevin is a young boy in a big family, and after they forget to bring him for the Christmas getaway, he is left home alone. This is nice for Kevin, however some thieves might ruin this Christmas for him.\nWhat this movie drives on is its concept. It's the ultimate childhood dream to be left alone and do whatever you wanted to. Chris Columbus captures the childhood wonder and fun perfectly, and Macaulay Culkin´s kids charm carries the vision. Eating whatever you want, seeing whatever you want, fight off bad guys, it's a kid's wish come true. This together with the heart is incredible. The movie has these really heartfelt speeches and conversations and combines it with humor to really make a fully rounded movie.\nBut I must admit, it feels like a slow movie, basically because it's a concept film before a plot one. The movie goes from scenario to scenario without much connection, and the loose storytelling just doesn't speak to me. I don't know what the movie tries to do half the time, and the first half doesn't really connect with the later\nThe acting is also a bit all over the place. While the charm of Macaulay Culkin is wonderful in this movie, the over acting doesn't really speak to me, with very repetitive gags like the scream done too many times. The standout here is the acting of Joe Pesci and the comedic timing of Daniel Stern. The later physical comedy and the comedic parring of the two really carries this movie.\nCourse, while I find it fun what Kevin is doing in the first half, I just wait for the house invasion. That is the best part of the movie, proving that physical comedy still is amazing when done to perfection.\nThe score is pretty good, but that's no surprise coming from my favorite composer, John Williams. It is a bit all over the place, but so is the movie. He captures every emotion perfectly here.\nThis is a good movie to me, but a lot of empty calories and just entertainment. It don't do more than that. As per usual when it domes to Chris Columbus movies, the concept, and its elements are childhood perfection and captures the essence of having fun as a kid, but creating a strong story and doing something with the concepts are always lacking. This is a classic, and I'll watch it again no doubt, but maybe from a distance next time.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,

There's an undeniable joy in watching a kid take on grown men in a symphony of hilariously comical beatdowns. It's the kind of cinematic catharsis that never gets old.\nSure, the plot's technological irrelevance in today's mobile-dominated world is glaring. A quick call would resolve the entire predicament.

The initial excessiveness mellows, and by the film's end, it delivers a surprisingly solid message, even if the finale leans a tad too saccharine for my taste. Fortunately, it doesn't overshadow the rest.\nThe true magic unfolds when Culkin faces off against Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The mischief, the traps, the sheer chaos - it's a festive spectacle that captures the spirit of Christmas in an unconventional, albeit hilarious, way. Nothing says 'tis the season like watching these two stumble through a gauntlet of burns, impalements, and face-smashing.\nHome Alone isn't just a movie; it's a time capsule of holiday joy. Its enduring appeal lies not just in the laughs but in its ability to transport you back to a simpler, more mischievous time. So, when you find yourself in need of a Christmas pick-me-up, just let young Kevin McCallister and his ingenious traps work their holiday magic.\nFORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\nVIDEO: 9/10.\nNative 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Good, Encode: Good, Master condition: Excellent\nAUDIO: 8/10.\nDTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: Good\nMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,
6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aeb2,tt0099785,Home Alone,xentrix667,24 December 2023,10,"There's an argument for a few movies to be the best Christmas movie ever, but I genuinely believe this is a perfect movie for all ages at christmastime and, 33 years later, still has not been surpassed. It's a Wonderful Life is probably the only film that might surpass it, but I'm not aa big a fan of it as this.\nMacauley Culkin is so good in this movie that it's hard to imagine anyone else who would have been able to play this role. How he plays off Pesci and Stern is fantastic and the level of slapstick is incredible.\nThat we also have Catherine O'Hara, a comic genius, who gets to share screen time with my favourite comic actor of all time, the affable, loveable and sorely missed John Candy, is a huge bonus.\nThat this isn't rated higher, or in the top 250 films of all time on IMDB, is a travesty. If you've never seen this film, which is something I can't believe is possible, you are in for an absolute treat and I guarantee you will come back to it over and over again.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aeb4,tt0099785,Home Alone,gccuconati,22 December 2023,9,"Home Alone is renowned as one of the best movies John Hughes has ever written/produced, alongside The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and many others. And I couldn't agree more with that!\nThe movie centers on 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (played by Macaulay Culkin), who lives in Chicago. Kevin's massive family is planning a family trip to Paris for Christmas. Unfortunately, Kevin feels ignored and unloved by his family. And the night before the plane ride, after ruining dinner when his mean older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray), goads Kevin into a fight by eating a cheese pizza reserved for him, and Kevin ends up being exiled to the attic by his mom, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), while Buzz gets off scot-free, an indignant Kevin hopes that he never sees his family again. Sure enough, that night, a winter storm sweeps the neighborhood, knocking out the McCallisters' power, and resetting the alarm clocks. The next morning, this leads to the McCallisters rushing chaotically to get ready, and in the ruckus, Kevin is left at home by mistake. Kevin believes that he made his family disappear, and enjoys himself at first, but begins to miss his family. To make matters worse, two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), the ""Wet Bandits"", are scheming to rob the McCallister residence. So, while Kate frantically struggles to book the family a flight home, Kevin must defend his home from Harry and Marv's burglary.\nAll the characters are brilliantly written! Our hero, Kevin, is a very likable and relatable protagonist. I mean, right from the pizza scene, he lets us know how it feels to be ignored and unloved by family. Harry and Marv are great comedic villains! As for Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom), the old man about who Buzz lied to Kevin, saying he was a murderer, (possible spoiler) when he finally speaks to Kevin, he's revealed to really be a kind-hearted old man, and a really good example of ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" (end possible spoiler) The only two unlikeable characters in the movie are Buzz and Kevin's rude uncle Frank (Gerry Bamman), who are both jerks. Although, Uncle Frank does get one of the best lines in the movie: ""LOOK WHATCHA DID, YA LITTLE JERK!!!"" HA!\nThe acting is tremendous. Macaulay Culkin is especially charming as Kevin. Nine years old, and already a real talent! Catherine O'Hara and John Heard (may he rest in peace) are praiseworthy as Kate and Kevin's father, Peter, respectively. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious as Harry and Marv!\nSpeaking of, the movie is packed from start to finish with delicious comedy! Those include Kevin watching a fake gangster movie called Angels With Filthy Souls (""Keep the change, ya filthy animal!"") and later using that to trick the pizza boy, or burning himself with aftershave TWICE. But the comic highlight of this movie is the booby traps that Kevin puts Harry and Marv through when they try to rob his house! From the paint cans to the face, to Harry literally STANDING THERE as a blowtorch burns his head, to Marv letting out a PRICELESS scream when Kevin puts Buzz's tarantula on his face... you name it! This movie's humor knows no boundaries! But of course, it's John Hughes, what did we expect? The movie, of course, is also heartwarming at times, like when Old Man Marley's true self is revealed, and of course, the ending.\nAnd, finally, the music! John Williams, the genius behind the scores of almost all of Steven Spielberg's movies, delivered a truly GORGEOUS score for this movie, special mention going to his mystical main theme. And don't get me started on the beautiful song that he composed, ""Somewhere in my Memory."" I actually sang along to that as I was watching this movie tonight.\nAll in all, Home Alone is one of the greatest movies John Hughes has ever made, and in my opinion, a must-see for anybody who loves comedy movies like me. Especially at Christmastime!!!\nOh, and by the way... ""KEVIN!!!! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY ROOM?!?!?!?!""",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,

This movie is better than Home Alone 2, Home Alone 3, and Home Alone 4. Home Alone just has great great actors. Every actor shines in front of the glowing light. This film is just really funny, even when the Wet Bandits are not getting hurt. It just has a clever plot that gets ruined and completely changed in Home Alone 3. I gotta say, my favorite characters are either Kevin or the Wet Bandits. Really Macaulay Culkin plays great as Kevin. It's literally a perfect match. I wish that there was a sequel with Macaulay Culkin and he meets the Wet Bandits again from his childhood. Kinda like A Christmas Story Christmas. In all, I give this movie a 8.6 out of 10. A great holiday movie to watch, even if you don't celebrate Christmas.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,
6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aeb6,tt15428134,Dunki,yashhraaj,2 January 2024,10,"""Dunki,"" a 2023 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film, stands as a testament to the enduring allure of quality cinema. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, this film not only captivates audiences with its unique storyline but also demonstrates the sustained interest in well-crafted movies, as evidenced by a nearly full theater 10 days post its release.\nSet against the backdrop of the ""donkey flight"" illegal immigration method, ""Dunki"" delves into the lives of a group of friends who seek a better life abroad but face the harsh realities of their decision. The narrative is a compelling mix of humor and poignant drama, reflecting the complexities and moral dilemmas of such a journey.\nThe film's casting is a masterstroke, with Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and Boman Irani delivering performances that are both authentic and powerful. Shah Rukh Khan, in particular, shines in a role that seems tailor-made for him, adding depth to the film's emotional core.\nRajkumar Hirani's direction is flawless, maintaining a balance between the comedic elements and the grave subject at hand. His expertise in storytelling is evident in every scene, capturing the audience's imagination and empathy. The screenplay, co-written with Abhijat Joshi and Kanika Dhillon, is crisp and engaging, complementing Hirani's vision perfectly.\nThe technical aspects of ""Dunki"" enhance its appeal. The editing is seamless, making for a smooth cinematic experience. The background score and songs, though not exceptionally memorable, fit well within the film's narrative fabric, enriching the emotional resonance of the story.\n""Dunki"" is more than a film; it's a reflection of the dreams and struggles of individuals seeking a better life. It's a movie that resonates with audiences beyond the fans of Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani. The film's ability to hold a nearly full theater 10 days after its release speaks volumes about its impact and the connection it has forged with its viewers.\nIn summary, ""Dunki"" is a must-see film that beautifully blends drama, romance, and comedy. Its poignant storyline, stellar performances, and masterful direction make it a standout in contemporary Indian cinema. It's a film that not only entertains but also inspires reflection and empathy, leaving a lasting impression on its audience.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,,,,

However, the film falls short with subpar songs and a overly stretched storyline spanning 25 years, causing a loss of audience interest. The mismatched on-screen couple of SRK and Tapsee Pannu due to age difference raises questions, impacting the believability. The first half drags on excessively, while the second half rushes through, hindering audience connection to the characters. In conclusion, Dunki is an average movie lacking emotional depth.

Surprisingly, it held up pretty well.\nNow, this needs to be immediately stated: your enjoyment of this movie will, quite simply, boil down to how much you can stomach Chevy Chase. Because, make no mistake about it, he is the main attraction here. From his patented physical comedy to his dry wit to his outlandish facial expressions (I'm particularly fond of the last one, in this movie), Chase has his paw marks all over this Jeremiah Chechik-directed romp.\nIf you are a Chase fan, like I am (controversies aside), chances are you will be laughing from the opening scene to the final credits. Chase's delivery is on-point, and Clark Griswold, while very much a typical Chase character, is fun to laugh with (or at) for 90-ish minutes.\nThe best laughs in this movie, though, come from the fantastic supporting cast. Whether you latch on to a young Juliette Lewis as Clark's moody teen daughter, Johnny Galecki as the mature (but young) Rusty Griswold, or the great E. G. Marshall as the elderly Art Smith, there are plenty of fun stocking stuffers to help elevate this film into ""classic"" territory.\nFor me, however, it was the inclusion of Mae Questel (as Bethany) late in the film that had me belly-laughing on the couch. From her perfect delivery to fantastic lines (thanks, John Hughes), Bethany - despite having less than five minutes of screen time - is infectious. To make matters even better, her dynamic with her husband (William Hickey) is something that we can all relate to.\nIs this a deep movie that will have you sobbing due to introspection when the final credits roll? Nope.\nAre there some sub-par acting performances that take you out of it? Yep (looking at you, Brian Doyle-Murray).\nIs it the best Christmas movie ever made? Of course not.\nThat being said, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation does enough (whilst minimally offending) to be considered a very good yule-related expedition.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,,

However, after rewatching this today i can honestly say that i've never seen such a bad movie ever. It has NO story, everything is just incidents after incidents that are totally predictable. The only funny thing is some of the adult jokes... in the beginning. Then it becomes too much. I don't see the humor in a man in his 40s flirting with a 20yo in front of his son. I can't see the humor in ridiculing a poor family who lives in a trailer. I can't see how animal cruelty is funny??\nIt seems like the script was made in an hour- i feel like this could be an assignment made by some highschoolers in AV class.\nIf you're wondering if it's worth spending 90 minutes watching this movie-- it's not. Spend it watching a movie with good characters, real humor, and some actual build-up stories. Or you'll sit there watching a movie with no connection to the characters and just annoyance.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,,

Special effects were different.\nThe acting is delightfully, hopefully, deliriously over-the-top. The mom's facial expressions are glorious. Ralphie's dream of the fun is timeless-we've all had a similar want that we were told was bad for us. Randy is so funny-nothing better than the scene where he is all bundled up.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aece,tt0085334,A Christmas Story,filmbuff-05706,23 December 2023,10,"A Christmas Story is one of the most beloved Christmas movies ever made, and rightfully so. It's funny, quotable, and simply so entertaining that it deserves the acclaim that it has had these last 40 years.\nThe story being told is narrated by a man named Ralphie, who is reminiscing on the best Christmas he ever had- in which he desired a Red Ryder BB Gun more than anything. Unfortunately, his Mom, teacher, and even a mall Santa tell him no, because he'll shoot his eye out.\nIn between Ralphie's quest to get his gun, there are iconic scenes in which a friend of his sticks his tongue to a frozen pole, Ralphie gets a bar of soap for swearing, his Dad wins a sexy lamp as an award, and more.\nThese iconic scenes are part of the charm that the movie has. There are also famous quotes, like ""You'll shoot your eye out"", ""Fra-jeel-ay...it must be Italian!"", ""Ovaltine? A crummy commercial?"" and ""I triple dog dare you!""\nBut apart from famous lines and scenes, there is other merit to A Christmas Story as well. One prime example is the actors who do great work- Peter Billingsley as Ralphie, Darren McGavin as The Old Man, Melinda Dillon as Raphie's Mom, Scott Swartz as Flick, and so forth.\nThere's more that I feel like sharing, but I am worried about spoiling too much of the plot.\nWhen I was really little, I was aware of this movie's existence and wanted to see it, but my Mom thought I was too young for it since it revolves around wanting a gun and it had quite a bit of swearing. Luckily, I have had plenty of time in my teen and adult years to see it, in fact I have now seen it over a dozen times- it's that enjoyable.\nIf your kid is under 8, that may be a little young for them to see A Christmas Story. Otherwise, this would be a great movie for families. Even 4 decades later, this still manages to charm and entertain audiences, and there is good reason. It's a holiday treasure.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aed0,tt0085334,A Christmas Story,elicopperman,19 December 2023,7,"40 years ago, humorist and storyteller Jean Shepherd's book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash was adapted for the screen in the form of A Christmas Story. While only a modest hit during its November 1983 release, the film would become a cult favorite over the years thanks to numerous television airings, thus leading to stage adaptations, a followup in 1994, two later day sequels in 2012 and 2022 respectfully, and a culturally significant place in the National Film Registry. So with this film having reached its 40th anniversary this year, its status remains more important than its overall quality.\nNow the story of youngster Ralphie Parker dreaming of his ideal Christmas gift, a ""Red Ryder air rifle."", is a story many people can relate to when it comes to struggling to keep one's hopes intact. As Ralphie has to put up with his cranky dad's odd choices and disgruntlement from school enemies like his teacher and rival bully Scut Farkus, Shepherd, co-writer Leigh Brown and director Bob Clark incorporate a melancholy feel of childhood curiosity not often seen in films today. Admittedly, perhaps the film favors its humorous setups a bit too much from its main plot since the film can often lose momentum in going from one comedic / dramatic scene to another. Most of these scenes are intended to develop Ralphie to do better, especially around his doting mother and little brother Randy, but they merely serve their purpose to the point where it mainly feels like we're watching school lessons instead of a fully realized movie. Also, the addition of certain characters like Farkus and Ralphie's school friends aren't as impactful as they could have been, although it certainly isn't all about them.\nPerhaps where the film succeeds the most is in Ralphie's imaginative scenarios, complete with absurd acting and fast paced editing techniques. As ludicrous as they can get, they capture the imagination any child could have in interpreting what could happen to them before they experience something in reality. In contrast to Shepherd's humorous narration as grown up Ralphie looking back on most of the scenarios, Peter Billingsley brings young Ralphie to life through genuine emotion and sly wit, arguably more so than a lot of the other child actors who are nonetheless as funny to watch as they are obnoxious. The addition of holiday themed music and merchandising further adds to the overwhelming nature one can see around the Christmas season, whether in rural Indiana or somewhere else. Arguably more memorable than composers Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer's original music, seeing adults and children throughout the film could make anyone watching feel welcome in the holiday spirit. As absurd as the film is conceptually, its heart is still in the right place.\nSo while A Christmas Story's narrative doesn't flow all that well due to favoring its humor over its story, it nonetheless offers just enough charming performances, witty scenarios and heartfelt holiday cheer for some amusement. Unless you're fed up with all of the film's popularity, I would say check this out at least once this Christmas season. It's by no means for everybody, but it does capture the cherished and not so cherished memories of childhood that we often don't see in film that much anymore. Besides, it's not like you'll shoot your eye out by watching this movie or anything like that.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,
6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aed1,tt0085334,A Christmas Story,gccuconati,14 December 2023,10,"Last night, I went to see A Christmas Story, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, at my local theater. And I can tell you this: whether you see it on the big screen, or in the comforts of your own home (as me and my family have done for years), it is a wonderful movie!\nSet in the fictitious town of Hohman, Indiana at Christmastime 1940, A Christmas Story centers on 9-year-old Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants just one thing for Christmas: a Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. But everyone he talks about it to, from his mom (Melinda Dillon) to his teacher, to even Santa at Higbee's, gives him the same response: ""You'll shoot your eye out."" Thanks in part to writer Jean Shepherd's brilliant narration as adult Ralphie, the movie has fabulous worldbuilding, and really fleshes out all the characters; especially Ralphie and his family. One thing that makes this movie timeless is that Ralphie and his family and the people they interact with don't feel like old-fashioned people; they feel like people we know even now. In particular, the sibling energy between Ralphie and his little brother Randy (Ian Petrella) reminds me of how my older brother and I acted toward each other as kids.\nLikewise, the acting is brilliant in this movie! As Ralphie, Peter Billingsley demonstrates remarkable talent, even for the age of 9. Ian Petrella plays Randy like the most realistic 6-year-old you'd ever meet in your life. But the two that stand out are Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin (may he rest in peace) as Ralphie's parents. Their back-and-forth is truly magical. Darren McGavin, in particular is hilarious as Ralphie's old man.\nThe movie also has a fabulous script, comedy and such memorable scenes and quotes. The banters between Ralphie's two best friends, Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R. D. Robb), are super entertaining, especially the scene where Flick is triple-dog dared by Schwartz to stick his tongue on the school flagpole, goes through with it, and ends up with a bandaged tongue. There's also the storyline regarding the old man's ""major award"", the famous leg lamp. Other highlights include Ralphie getting a bar of soap in his mouth for saying a dirty word (""Ohhhhhh, ffffffuuuuuuuudge!"" ""Only I didn't say fudge."" HA!), the old man beating on the faulty furnace while swearing in gibberish, Ralphie's melodramatic fantasies, Ralphie beating bully Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) senseless while cursing up a storm, and let's NOT forget the truly brilliant scene of Ralphie visiting Higbee's Santa. That is indeed, as Roger Ebert said, the best department store Santa visit ever captured on film! And whenever we get a Christmas tree every year, my brother and I always quote the Christmas tree salesman: ""Now, HERE'S a tree! This here is a TREE!""\nAnd last but not least, there's the music. True to form, Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer wove some classic Christmas tunes into this movie's score. They also perfectly chose all the songs to use!\nAll in all, A Christmas Story is a fabulous Christmas movie that will never age! In fact, I consider it one of THE movies to watch around Christmastime!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,

Because the story is splendid, hilarious moments, heartwarming moments and the relatable characters. The main protagonist is Ralphie Parker, He is a boy, who wanted the BB Gun for Christmas, but his mother said ""it will shoot your eye out"", Because She is concerned about his safety. The one-liners are memorable as well. The hilarious and awesome part of the movie is when Ralphie Parker beats up the mean bully called Scut Farkus, It reminds me of Wendy Testaburger, when She beats up Eric Cartman from South Park in Breast Cancer Show Ever (2008). Like Ralphie's mother, Ralphie's Teacher and the Mall Santa did concern for Ralphie's eye safety as well. But at Christmas Ralphie got a BB Gun as a present by his own father. He first tried to use the BB Gun for the target practices, but the bullets didn't touch Ralphie's eye and he is very lucky. Sadly the Parker Family's roast Turkey dinner is ruined by the dogs, So They are going to have the Peking Duck dinner at the Chinese Restaurant instead.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aed3,tt0085334,A Christmas Story,auskooper,10 December 2023,6,"A Christmas Story is a Christmas movie that's pretty realistic in nature. Unlike other Christmas movies like the Grinch, the Santa Clause, and Elf, a Christmas Story seems likely to actually happen in real life. The Grinch is hairy and not likely to be a creature to exist in real life and with him growing two heart sizes at the end (literally). In Elf and the Santa Clause, Santa actually exists. A Christmas Story has nothing like Santa, elves, spirits of different times, or a green, hairy creature. It seems pretty close to something that could happen in real life, in which I could find a little boring. When I watch something Christmas, I prefer if it has something like Santa or the Grinch or the Spirits in A Christmas Carol than it's a Christmas that could actually happen in real life. As well, some moments seem like general winter than specifically Christmas. Any way you look at this movie, it's still a Christmas classic. I feel like it's far from the top of my favorite Christmas movies. Even with the complaints I gave in this review, I don't think I could give it a bad rating (5 or less). 6 is the worst I can give without it being seen as a negative rating.

If it strikes me how 23 years later the film still has the same meaning, how the true meaning of Christmas is forgotten and how it has become a commercial era, a superficial era, based on consumerism. Taylor Momsen really plays a very good character, she and the Grinch with the soul of the film, without forgetting Max too, Cindy reminds us of the innocence of children, without malice, they see the good side of people, always obviously being a reflection From the upbringing that has been given, she reminds us that everyone deserves to be accepted, that everyone deserves to be accompanied at Christmas. I liked knowing the story of the Grinch, about his childhood, about how bullying caused him consequences. Although it is a film whose target audience is children, it really generates a lot of reflection. For the time, the makeup and costumes were spectacular, they won an Oscar for a reason.

Here he is with some staff and students, who have nowhere else to go during the holidays.\nPaul tries to keep order among the people at school. After a few days, he is left alone with student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) and chef Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). During their isolating state, the three get to know each other well. In this way they try to help each other with their problems and past.\nThis entire film was shot in real practical locations of a school in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, during a holiday so the school was empty. For example, no film sets or soundstages were used for this film. This gives the film a realistic look and feel while watching.\nWriter David Hemingson, who is better known as a writer of various TV series, has managed to write a good story with this story. He uses well-known concepts where different characters unintentionally end up together, but knows how to incorporate the characters well into the film. During the film, the characters get to know each other better and discover what bothers them or what they love. Together they try to help each other with their passions or annoyances. As a viewer, you sympathize more and more with the characters as you learn more about them.\nWhat also makes you care about the characters is the acting of the three actors in the film. Paul Giamatti comes across well as a more grumpy loner, but throughout the film you learn why his character has become this way and that there is still a good and kind person inside him. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's character also has her mysterious storylines, but serves more as someone who tries to maintain order and balance between a grumpy teacher and problematic student. This was only Dominic Sessa's first acting role, but this is not reflected in his performance in the film. He may not have known how to use a rotary telephone, but this is more due to his young age. He also knows how to deliver heart-warming acting for characters with a less than ideal past. Together the three actors know how to provide good acting, characters that you as a viewer start to care about and empathize with more and more during the film.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,,,,

It is EXCEPTIONALLY rare in 2023/24 to see a historical-based film that adheres to the actual time period it is depicting. That alone gained a couple star here. The entire film ""feels"" like the 1960/70s. It isn't littered with altered dialog to conform to current social demands.. it come across as an honest portrayal of the time period - which few productions even attempt today.\nOverall the film is a slow grind about a relationship. It's entirely human interest. While I was engaged the entire film, and don't regret spending the time to watch this, it's not something overly memorable on the whole. But still.. it's worth watching if you are in the mood for a relatively subtle feel-good story.\nThe biggest downside for me was the soundtrack.... it seemed honest to the time period - being more ""soft rock"" or ""lazy stoner"" tunes of the time period, nothing which conveys any excitement or interest.. more somber music in general. You know, the type of music that makes one think the performer may be half asleep or loaded up on mood suppressors. But, admittedly, I may have noticed it more because I find such music mildly irritating.\nSo minus a couple stars because there's no repeat viewing aspect or takeaway memory from the film. And minus another due to the morose soundtrack.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,,,,

So there I was in the midst of this movie when it suddenly hit me it was a Christmas movie! In any event it's a nice movie with a nice cast of three individuals played by the always good Paul Giamatti as a disliked teacher, the strong film debut of Dominic Sessa as a disliked student and Da'Vine Joy Randolph who is just about guaranteed an Oscar for this when the nominations and awards come out in the coming months. She plays the school's head cook stuck with the other two over the Christmas holidays. This is primarily about the sour relationship between the teacher and student growing warmer and warmer and both learning how to be better people. Alexander Payne is a fine director and writer, though he did not write this somewhat manipulative piece and I wish he had. It might have been a bit more sharp than sentimental.

It is set in the late 1969-70, and the students are mainly privileged sons of wealthy parents, and often spoiled. Paul teaches ancient history, and is well versed. But he is not a people person. He doesn't change with the times, and as a result is disliked by his students and the other teachers. Yes, he is terrified of losing his job. He gives his students no slack, which is difficult for the school, as those parents expect their sons to get an easy ride to top universities, so they can avoid the draft. It is the time of the war in Vietnam and the draft, and keeping in college means keeping out of the military. There is the regular Holiday break, but a handful of students can't leave, so Paul is set to be the 'babysitter' and one especially difficult student is Angus Tully. Tully has been expelled from three other schools and the next step for him is a military school. Paul expects to run the holiday as if it were a regular school period, which becomes even harder when all but Tully get a chance to leave. With them is Mary, the school cook and a black woman whose son was recently killed in Vietnam. And she loves cigarettes. So together these three stranded persons have to deal with each other, and they have their own set of problems.

6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aee6,tt14849194,The Holdovers,SAMTHEBESTEST,1 January 2024,6,"The Holdovers (2023) :\nBrief Review -\nThis much-hyped, feel-good Christmas comedy-drama comes with a certain appeal. The Holdovers may just stand out as the most favourite Christmas film of 2023 because there weren't many to compete with it. Although this one is a feel-good and emotional drama with a lack of good comedy, it can only appeal to a certain section of the audience. The first reason for this is that it is a slow movie. It does not really have that pace, that many engaging factors, or so-called comedy to keep you entertained. Rather, it has a lot of drama overtaken by some nice emotional moments towards the end. The other reason is the story. See, it's a very depressing tale. On Christmas, you might want to see something enchanting, right? The film is about a student who is left alone during the Christmas holidays with the most resentful teacher at the school. How many guys are there who are left alone on Xmas? Many, but do they all give a damn about it? No. They just find ways to get kicked out of these unwanted situations and find pleasure somewhere else. Only a few people don't have a choice, so they are stuck and spend time in solitude. The Holdovers is for them. The film lacks a story that can appeal to every kind of audience since the conflicts are purely based on some particular character suffering through some specific problems. That doesn't happen to everyone, so I'm afraid that not everybody can relate to it. At least I didn't. That's what took me away from the film. I would have loved to see regular teacher-student conversions instead of these strained issues. On the positive side, the performances are superb. Paul Giamatti and his eyes-I mean, how did they find such a perfect fit for the role? He looked so genuine there. Alexander Payne's direction is subtle, but too subtle, I think. Too slow, too. Overall, a fine take, but it could have been more entertaining and funny.\nRATING - 6/10*\nBy - #samthebestest.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,,,,
6595b4daa783f0cdafc9aee7,tt14849194,The Holdovers,akcenat,1 January 2024,8,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.\nStory is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.\nThe performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.\nOverall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,,,,

The scenery is beautiful from the opening in the camp behind the battle lines to the final snow falling setting.

The storyline, about 2 ex-army men who team up to perform a Christmas show at a ski lodge, is hardly interesting, engaging or even festive.\nI've watched many classic Christmas films in my long life including Elf, Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, Polar Express, and A Christmas Carol, to name a few. They are all way superior, entertaining and festive, whereas White Christmas is saddled with a weak plot that just never gets off the ground. Why is a show about putting on a show regarded as entertainment is beyond me! The whole plot in fact is so tedious I find it hard to maintain any interest every time I try to watch this. It is a truly boring snooze fest.\nI guess it probably means a lot more to those who grew up watching this from a very young age. I am also guessing it means a lot more to Americans than anyone growing up or living outside the USA.\nAs for the title White Christmas, I think the makers should be sued under the Trade Descriptions Act.

The gist of the plot is one of loyalty and integrity, but there is plenty of daft comedy interspersed to keep the whole thing from becoming too earnest or sentimental. The dance numbers are expertly choreographed and the musical numbers from Irving Berlin including the belters ""Sisters"" (with a little help from Gloria Wood) and ""Blue Skies"" keep the toes tapping too... It's a cheery, gentle romantic comedy that puts a smile on your face and reinforces any faith in the human spirit that might need topping up.

In Dream Scenario, Cage plays Paul Matthews, a man whose face suddenly starts popping up in millions of strangers' dreams, turning him into an overnight sensation. At first, it's all sunshine and rainbows-talk show appearances, lucrative endorsements, even a fan club of sleepwalkers. But as the line between reality and dreams blurs, Paul's dream-self morphs into a grotesque, cannibalistic monster, and his waking life becomes a waking nightmare.\nDirector Kristoffer Borgli crafts a film that's equal parts hilarious and horrifying, a twisted satire on the fleeting nature of fame and the dark underbelly of the internet age. Think Being John Malkovich meets Inception with a dash of Twilight Zone, and you'll get a taste of the bizarre brilliance that is Dream Scenario.\nCage, as always, is a force of nature, inhabiting his role with gusto and delivering deadpan lines with a wink and a raised eyebrow. He's perfectly cast as the bewildered common person thrust into the limelight; his comedic timing is impeccable even as his character descends into existential dread. The supporting cast, including Julianne Nicholson as Paul's long-suffering wife, are equally stellar, adding depth and humour to the story.\nThe film's score is a pulsing electronic nightmare, perfectly complementing the unsettling visuals and amplifying the tension. The cinematography is equally inventive, playing with dream logic and distorted perspectives to keep us guessing.\nBut Dream Scenario isn't just about the laughs and scares. It's a film that asks questions about the nature of identity, the power of collective consciousness, and the dangers of a society obsessed with viral fame. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, making you question your own dreams and the reality you wake up to.\nNow, it's not perfect. The pacing can be a bit uneven at times, and the ending, while satisfying, feels a tad rushed and less subtle in its satire than the first two-thirds. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise masterfully crafted film.\nDream Scenario is a wild ride, a waking nightmare that's both hilarious and thought-provoking. It's a film that will leave you laughing, gasping, and maybe even questioning your own sanity. Try Dream Scenario if you are in search of a film that is unlike anything you have ever seen before; however, do not hold me responsible if you find yourself unable to sleep afterwards!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,

Unfortunately it turned into something just abysmal like so many films today. That have no umph just drearly plod along.. its such a shame because this film had two things going for it. A unique plot and Nicholas cage who plays his part well with what he got. I just feel the potential was wasted because whoever came up with the idea didn't know where to go with the story or bring it to life more. I really wish this had had a team behind it like the makers of the Truman Show & we could've had another classic like it here. The idea would be like a 8/10 cage 8/10.. but everything else kept knocking the stars down sadly. Though I did LOL at the fart scene but that was the last redeemable moment. & when I think back I can't help but laugh hard at his self serving Internet apology scene. Which he's called out on, which leads you to feel bad for his character despite having just Cringed hard 10seconds earlier.. Leaving me in No doubt at all based on that performance alone Cage IS a Fantastic actor. That was nailed perfectly. I feel others got it right that if the writers here couldn't come up with something to tie it properly it would've been better a short twighlight zone episode. 2 of the producers on this film I'm not a fan of any of their work.

So i will state some things i think kinda stank with this film before i start my praise. Even though I wasn't caught up in the stank there was surely a bit of stank.\n-The last 20 minutes or so of the film were so bizzare and off kilter. Anything good or interesting the film had going for it kind of evaporated. It was a fine ending, but the plot just dissapeared inot strangeness.\n-Although the concept is very interesting, this movie is a slow burn and really struggles in the beggining to engage. My movie theater was suprisingly full and people were talking in the beggining because they couldnt get into it.\n-This concept is so interesting... but I think they could have done SO MUCH more with it. There was a twinge of disappointment that they didn't squeeze all the creative juices from this idea.\nOkay so now that i just took a massive duce on this film, i would like to say i really like this film. Nick Cage knocked it out of the park with his performance. He either is so laughably bad, or REALLY great. And he was really great in this! I really loved this film because of it's lessons in guilt, action and the reaction of making mistakes upon our conciousness.

Some scenes are a little cringy, due to the clichéd direction they take, but that's fine for these types of movies.\nMy only criticism is there was one scene with the Elf making reference to Christmas not being about Jesus, she was a bad elf, but IMO it's best not to include offensive things like that.\nOverall it's a wholesome, feel-good movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,,

Hayes does an excellent job of creating a thoughtful and provocative film based on a sensational event. Although Hayes loves melodrama, he takes a non-fiction story and parallels it with a fictional story of making a film about it. The characters played by Portman and Moore are both observed objects who create a self-narrative where they are the heroes. However, in the end, they both turn out to be delusional. The scene where Moore's character makes up Portman expresses the connection.

The film lacks the spark of enthusiasm that might have made up for the fact that there simply isn't an interesting story here to begin with. Deals with mental illness but only goes as deep as the glancing edge, and prefers instead to be mainly an uninsightful commentary about borderline narcissism, selfish, poor behavior, and some dull bits about acting and being an actor. Many scenes lacking in meaning and displaying only average dialogue and performances should have been cut out. Avenues that should have been pursued or at least satisfactorily explained were not, such as how and why would an actress spend days and weeks with someone they are meant to portray, who is patently uninteresting, and whose mannerisms and motivations can be imitated and deciphered very quickly? Who cares why these bland and monotonous individuals made odd life choices? It is the film's job to make things compelling or shed light on something, and nothing is really even interesting here. Each main character has flaws, but what this reveals about the human condition is zero. We simply witness tedious people having tiresome conversations which reveal far too little. We can guess, but always lurking at every moment is the dreaded ""Who Cares?"" No matter how hard you apply yourself to the themes covered, you will come up light, unless you enjoy medium temperature suburban drama that goes on for two solid hours with scant material to explore. Yes, we see there are some ""meta"" themes to pay attention to, but they are not substantial enough to make up for the lack of convincing emotion or energy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,,

That was nicely done. Somewhat shockingly, the music was out of an '80s or early '90s movie. It gave the effect of being more like a Lifetime movie. That doesn't particularly bother me but I just thought it was extremely interesting. You don't see that in movies today. And for good reason I think. People have moved past that musical style.\nThis was approaching a seven for me but didn't quite get there. The positive elements again were the interesting storyline and the tension among some of the characters and the development of the plot and the characterization. The drawback was again the music was a little off and the story just wasn't quite as compelling as a seven rated movie would be.\nIt was funny in the graduation scene how they were clearly attempting to announce the graduates in alphabetical order but failed. Sloppy writing there. Also after they announced about eight students whose last name started with ""A"" the principal quickly said congratulations to the class of 2015 without any kind of a segue.\nABOUT MY REVIEWS:\nI do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.\nMy scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK.

I guess she really was trying to be Gracie. She exploited him.\nWhen Gracie and Elizabeth were applying makeup and Gracie started using that ridiculous childish lisp, you finally got confirmation that Gracie was a master manipulator and she knew exactly what she was doing when she sexually assaulted a child, who then became her husband and the father of her three children.\nArt imitating life, as Mary Kay seems just as unhinged (in the interview you can find on the internet) when she asked Vili, ""Who was the boss"", when everyone, including Mary Kay, knew that the boss was her. Only Vili didn't know. So sad.\nI recommend this film. Good acting from all three main characters.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,,

The film could very well take advantage of this factor and the result could be positive. However, even without needing to use this medium, the film manages to develop a narrative with moments full of sexual tension, but without taking advantage of explicit nudity. The narrative aims to explore, through a dark comedy, the characters' problematic relationship. The problematization of the romance experienced by the characters is constantly remembered. We, together with the protagonist, seek to understand what led this couple to get together. In many moments, the film puts us face-to-face with Gracie (Julianne Moore), causing us to raise doubts about the problematization of that couple, even though the audience knows it is wrong. The film makes it clear how Joe Yoo (Charles Melton) has not matured enough because of his relationship. However, when the character seeks to face this doubt, it is when he frees himself from a feeling that was kept and hidden.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b41,,,,,

It's a shame considering the tragic story it seeks to tell. Leonardo DiCaprio is starting to lose his luster and was severely misplaced as a WWI veteran who's pushing 50 but was continually portrayed as an young man. De Niro has never been a good actor and this film highlights how mediocre he's always been. Go back and watch any Scorsese/De Niro film, and you'll realize how overrated they both are. Yes, I'm talking about films like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Cape Fear, and even Goodfellas. Most people believe these are good movies because the critics tell you they are, but if you can watch them with an open mind you'll realize how terrible they all are.

The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.\nI put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

I appreciate that this story was both written down, and also interpreted with the Osage Nation Members. The costume was just beautiful, as were the indigenous actors. I always delight in their way. I was very glad that I rented this movie in support of this type of media. What strikes me the most is that everyone was intertwined, almost as if they seemed to have no way to stop the madness while living out a grotesque version of life. I guess that this rings true, even today, as we all know where the tax dollars go, and for what purpose, yet we live on in the inevitable denial of natural law.

That co writer and director Justine Triet manages to give moving, convincing renditions of each of these three subjects without putting undue strain upon my patience (I was never close to being bored) heralds, in my opinion, a most promising career. I definitely look forward to the next film by Ms. Triet and will, hopefully, be able to view her prior ones.

The film is highly intelligent and particular in what it chooses to reveal to the audience and what to conceal from them.\nNever is there absolute certainty of what the truth must be. As the interrogations progress, we learn more and more about the characters and the complicated backstory of the marriage that seems to have ended in a murder.\nThe way the hearings -- via bits of evidence that take us into flashbacks -- serve to characterize the characters is brilliantly done and feels completely natural (nothing is ever revealed in a clunky or contrived manner). These damaged individuals are regarded with honesty; there is no clear villain.\nAll throughout, the acting is absolutely first-rate. Sandra Hüller (despite the pessimism I expressed when I first wrote about the movie) is, rightfully, on track for an Oscar nomination and, per some people's predictions, possibly a win.\nAnd if you thought Dominic Sessa (The Holdovers) and Charles Melton (May December) were considerable breakouts this year, wait until you see Milo Machado Graner in this; it may be the best child performance I have ever seen, which is to say nothing of his canine co-star.

And these dialogues that we see and hear, throughout the 150 minutes of the film, are almost always extremely tense and impactful.\nThe film addresses the various relationships (husband/wife, mother/son, father/son, mother/lawyer) and the court scenes themselves in a way that is almost always quite ""cold"".\nThe dialogues and relationships between characters are generally of some apparent coldness, with few warm moments, although there are also some and they appear at the ""right"" moments.\nThe film is very well directed by director Justine Triet, as she manages to make the film go far beyond the trial for possible murder, this trial brings with it several other trials such as the relationships between the couple and between the mother and the son, giving no answers definitive, approaching them in a powerful but ""neutral"" way, letting the viewer reflect on what they are seeing.\nExcellent performances from all the actors, with special emphasis on the protagonist Sandra Huller and the ""little"" Milo Machado Graner.\nDespite the length (150 minutes) the film never ""drags"", the many dialogues we see are always interesting, tense and revealing something more about the characters.\nVerdict: very good.

One day the man lies dead in the snow, apparently having fallen out of a window. Was it an accident? Suicide? Or even murder? More and more inconsistencies appear, so that the writer comes under increasing suspicion. And even feels compelled to call on a lawyer (Swann ARLAUD), whom she knows from before, to provide legal advice. Soon there will actually be a court hearing in nearby Grenoble, where hopefully all the uncertainties can be cleared up...\nJustine TRIET offers a lot in her film, which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival: courtroom film, thriller, marital drama. However, all genre elements are essentially broken down into their components. Can the truth even be found like this? And weren't both married couples also accomplished writers or literary educators? The script that TRIET wrote together with her life partner Arthur HARARI also plays with this very cleverly. In German-speaking countries, the phenomenon of autofictional literature was only recognized with some delay. It was only the success of the Norwegian author Karl Ove KNAUSGARD that introduced German-speaking readers to a type of literature that has been very popular in France since Marguerite DURAS and Annie ERNAUX (NOBEL PRIZE for Literature 2022). Autofiction means that the author appears autobiographically in a fictional text. Actually a contradiction from which there is no escape for readers. Unless the text is received either autobiographically or fictionally. Both together don't work.\nIn relation to the film's plot: What does it actually mean when a couple of writers autofictionally tear each other apart in their own relationship? Are conflicts then real or are they almost acted out in order to be able to exploit them in an autofictional way? And what happens to a child who is helpless in this struggle? However, these abstract questions are interwoven into an exciting plot that can rise above such background information. But that can be crucial for winning film awards. Just think of the year 1994, when a certain Quentin TARANTINO finally used the literary option of not having to tell a plot chronologically, which had been tried and tested since the turn of the century (i.e. Since 1900!!!), in a film with perfectly normal genre elements and It also rightly received the Palme d'Or in Cannes.\nA little fun fact on the side: screenwriter Arthur HARIRI has a cameo appearance in the film as a literary critic for a French television show.\nBut all of this should not be defamed as too calculated! Justine TRIET delivered an outstanding film. The script by her and Arthur HARARI offers pure excitement and is at the same time literary satisfying. Someone has to do that first! Basically, this can only happen about every 30 years! And then Sandra HÜLLER! What more can you say about this exceptional actress? It takes the whole thing into another league. She already has the EUROPEAN FILM AWARD, a nomination for the ACADEMY AWARD should now be inevitable!!!\nP. S.: At P. I. M.

Especially in the courtroom scene, this movie evoked a thrilling feeling better than an action movie.\nSo I call it a lean movie, with no excess in the film. Because of its beauty and neatness, this is a type of film that has a chance to get an Oscar.\nThe main point of Anatomy of a Fall is quite similar to the issue in Marriage Story (2019) that talks about the fall of a relationship.\nAnatomy of a Fall is in the courtroom drama genre. Everyone fights to prove their innocence in court. Because of this point, we can see a crack in the relationship and a big explosion in the movie.\nThat's why the movie is named ""Anatomy of a Fall."" It doesn't only mean an accident of the falling victim but also shows the falling of the relationship that everyone doesn't want to face.\nSo this film teaches me that the image of having a family is not always as beautiful as in ads, but it has many problems that can make couples stressed.\nTherefore, talking and compromise may be the best solution in married life. It may be the way to make everyone win and no one lose in the game.\nIn the acting part, Sandra Hüller gave the best performance and should be nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars.\nI liked her eyes and facial expression that always show confusion. It made the audience feel pity for her unlucky situation.\nBesides Sandra Huller, every character is memorable.\nTo sum up, Anatomy of a Fall is a star this year. I guess it has a chance to be nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Foreign Film.\nAnyway, compared to other candidates this year, I still personally prefer ""Past Lives"" more than ""Anatomy of a Fall,"" even though it has a slightly better performance.\nIn 2020, Parasite from South Korea was awarded the Palme d'Or and Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\nPossibly, we may see Anatomy of a Fall have a chance like Parasite as well.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

Ariadne wants Poirot to help expose the medium (Michelle Yeoh) as a fake. Poirot soon spots chicanery, but events suddenly take a turn towards the seemingly real supernatural. Have the dead returned to take murderous revenge on the living? Or is a more human agency at work? What follows is a journey through accusations, alibis, red herrings... and ghosts. Who's guilty? What's real - and what isn't? The answers may not be as cut-and-dried as you'd expect.\nAlthough Branagh is a talented actor, he generally misses the mark for me. But here he's excellent, as Poirot struggles to get to grips with what he knows cannot exist. Tina Fey, whilst not someone I would cast as Ariadne, does a good job. Michelle Yeoh convinces as the medium. Kelly Reilly is okay as the former opera singer. The rest of the featured cast (Jamie Dornan, Kyle Allen, Riccardo Scamarcio, Camille Cottin, and young Jude Hill) are all very good. Branagh's direction is tight, and he handles the supernatural aspects well (I'd like to see him tackle an out and out ghost story - something along the lines of The Woman in Black). The film was largely shot on location, and the cinematography makes the most of the Venice scenery. The minus for me is that either the mystery distracts from the ghost story, or the ghost story distracts from the mystery; they don't quite fit together. It feels like two unrelated stories spliced together (which it basically is).

Sadly I have to say that the movie rather disappointed me. It definitely wasn't terrible and it had its franchise trademarks but in general I don't think that it was as good as it could have been. The horror aspects mostly didn't work and were rather hilarious than scary or realistic and just didn't fit in. Also I think that the reveal was unspectacular and slightly predictable.

Riccardo Scarmaccio looks born to feature in this film, with that haunting face, but is rather underused.\nThese films aren't intended to be realistic - more glossy, tongue-in-cheek fun, but the laughs were all unintended here.\nI can't say how closely this follows the source material, but the central plot is a bit lacking.

The story doesn't hold together quite as well as either Murder on the Orient Express or Death on the Nile - which were well crafted mysteries with tightly told narratives. This, by comparison, is somewhat of a mess of ideas that only barely manages to come together in the end.\nLet me start by saying what I liked about this... the acting and directing are very well done - as is to be expected. The movie is a visual treat with lots of nice set design throughout. And in the end, it is a decent enough murder mystery that's sort of vaguely in the style of a proper Hercule Poirot story.\nThat last bit is kind of the issue though. At times, this is crafted such that it *really* feels like a proper Hercule Poirot story... but at other times it feels like a Scooby Doo episode. The movie leans too heavily toward the ""haunting"" aspect of the title - and while some of these ""spooky / haunting"" moments are explained away at the end, some of them simply *CANNOT* be explained away. Upon the conclusion of this movie I immediately researched to see if the original Agatha Christie novel featured this absurd ambiguity surrounding the ""haunting"" aspect of this film - only to find that there is no such Agatha Christie novel at all. This movie is only very loosely based on a totally different Agatha Christie novel that features no such ridiculous haunting aspects. While I can appreciate the desire to tell a story that goes in a different direction than Agatha Christie fans might expect - I feel like they pushed a little too far into Scooby Doo territory to be taken seriously.\nThat having been said though, I mostly enjoyed the movie despite some of these issues and I would absolutely recommend it for folks who liked the first two films. But if you're only going to watch one of them - then stick with either of the first two movies because they're both better than this one.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,

6595b4dba783f0cdafc9af2f,tt1877830,The Batman,fernandoschiavi,1 January 2024,8,"Reeves acts as a conductor in love with his orchestra, in this case, his perspective on the best version of Batman and Gotham. Bearing in mind the need to build a traumatized detective working in an oppressive environment, the screenwriter also uses all his resources to, alongside Peter Craig, bring to life a narrative meticulously thought out to serve as a new origin for Batman in cinemas. If you saw the title when you bought your ticket, you probably already have in your memory passages such as the death of Bruce Wayne's parents or the beginning of the hero's role in fighting crime. In this way, Reeves wastes no time recreating these sequences and tries to use the opening minutes of the work to take us on a deep dive into the darkness of Gotham. Although the city already has a Batman established in his crusade against crime - whose ""omnipresent"" ghost imposes fear among criminals -, the character has been active for just over two years, always showing his growing impatience and revolt.\nThe director's vision is uniform for all aspects of the film, showing the solidity of the project even with all its ambitions. Unlike more recent adaptations, which involved Christopher Nolan's realism and Zack Snyder's mythology, Reeves constructs the atmosphere of the work as a dark and pessimistic portrait of today's society. To this end, he stops using a traditional dramatic crescendo leading to a climax, and prefers to transform the long duration into a constant line - constantly hammering into our heads with that place where very few are worthy of salvation. An easy-to-observe example of this concept is the use of light by cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Dune""). While most of the scenes take place at night, with the creative team making use of shadows as an active character in the film, the daytime sequences appear to have been sucked in, as if Gotham had no right to have anything alive - not even colors. Still in this approach, it is worth highlighting the use of red and orange tones in scenes where the darkness is illuminated by these colors (be it the flare or the fire), reflecting not only the bloodthirsty of the place, but also Batman's explosive personality, still impulsive and believing that anonymity gives him the freedom to do what he wants. Fraser's photography also adopts a reduced depth of field or even slightly blurred planes, using resources such as smoke or constant rain to limit the viewer's vision - thus illustrating the oppressive and claustrophobic world inhabited by those people.\nRobert Pattinson plays Batman masterfully, and his interpretation makes it clear that Bruce Wayne uses his alter ego as escapism to escape his still recent traumas. Not by chance, the character spends the vast majority of the almost 3-hour running time (which could certainly be reduced) dressed as Batman. Sounding depressed and pessimistic, Wayne speaks little and in a low voice, maintaining an emotional distance even from his loyal butler and father figure Alfred (who Andy Serkis plays with a mix of affection and impatience) - and on the few occasions we see the billionaire Without his uniform, he demonstrates pragmatism by exchanging his suits and tuxedos for a cap and backpack, which allows him to walk around the city incognito, but always ready to put on his mask when necessary. Of the same, the flashy batbike from Christopher Nolan's films gives way to a common, discreet version, while the batmobile discards the stylized design to present itself as a vehicle that appears to be made of reinforced metal and that Reeves presents as if it were a monstrous creature out of from a cave to scare the villains. The existence of Bruce Wayne seems to be a mere formality in the film, and the little development given to him uses layers very similar (not to say exactly the same) to Batman. It is understandable that spending so much time on a mission means that, without the uniform, the character continues to act and think like the hero. However, all the emotional appeal that Bruce carries with him, as well as the important asymmetry between the millionaire and the vigilante were left aside. There is certainly room to develop him better, especially if we take into account that this is a film with a backwards origin, in which the protagonist begins the narrative as a disbelieving Batman in Gotham and spreading fear, and we see his journey of ""redemption"" to become a figure of hope for everyone.\nReturning to the beginning, the opening also fulfills a second and equally important purpose: to introduce the film's villain. And there is no one in Batman's considerable pantheon of antagonists who invokes the need for a resourceful detective as much as the Riddler. Especially when behind the mask, the character synthesizes the antithesis of the method and detail of a serial killer with the chaos provided by a mass agitator. All of this wrapped in a web that mixes past and present traumas with the desire to impose gigantic changes in the future. Paul Dano's Riddler not only has fun while spreading riddles to cover his tracks, but he also shows that he knows communication methods and strategies and knows how to use them to his advantage and always be ahead of those who investigate him. It is worth highlighting the parallel that can be made between the villain's final strategy and real life, rekindling the warning about the danger of the expansion of forums and websites that shamelessly disseminate the most execrable ideas ever produced by human beings.\nHowever, no matter how different ""Batman"" tries to be, there is no way to ignore that he was born in comics. And Reeves is not ashamed to embrace what the medium has to offer and takes great care of the action and intensity of everything that is happening. So much so that, even though it's a terribly long film, it's easy to enjoy the more than three hours amidst so much happening. The big highlight here are the fight scenes. They are all very well-choreographed and put together in a dry and very raw way, without the acrobatics and exaggerations of other productions. The idea here is to get closer to a street fight, with a crazy person dressed as a bat beating up criminals in dark alleys. Likewise, the entire Batmobile scene is incredible precisely because it is not afraid to accelerate towards the surreal for the sake of good entertainment. Okay, Batman caused dozens of accidents and a pileup that could have killed a lot of people, but everything is so visually impressive that you just accept it and cheer when you see the vehicle come out of the flames in the middle of a chase that is as long as it is exciting.\nAs already mentioned, in addition to psychological horror, the film also uses several noir elements: many dark tones and shadows combined with white in the aesthetics (Gotham is almost always dark and rainy) and beautiful photography. The detective investigation that goes from piece to piece, to discover who the killer is and why he commits such crimes and a main character with many internal demons and pessimistic views about the city he protects. Unlike several previous works, one of the points of the film is not to show how Bruce decided to become a vigilante - we don't have the fateful alley scene shown at any point in the film, but rather to show his detective skills in contrast to the emotional shaken by his personal tragedy. Fans of the comics will easily be able to see that the basis of the script is influenced by stories from the beginning of his career and focused more on the detective side of our hero, such as ""The Long Halloween"", ""Year Zero"" and ""Year One"".\n""Batman"" is a huge film, both in length and plot, with a somewhat slow initial pace, which may bother viewers eager for immediate action, as well as pleasing those who prefer a good narrative development with everything perfectly connected. . Of course, it could be shorter and the story more condensed, but when misfortunes happen, this ends up becoming just a detail. Despite this, the film rescues elements of the character that are sometimes neglected in his more recent stories, uniting them with a degree of realism: Gotham is a large and violent city (inspired by real cities of great corruption, such as Chicago) whose heroic protector, at the beginning of his career, is someone who uses intelligence and creativity, gathers clues to crimes, infiltrates places where there are likely suspects and, instead of fighting invincible ninjas or aliens, faces robbers and other lesser street thugs. Grandiose, exposing the rampant corruption and violence present in the city. It's a good adaptation of more down-to-earth Bat-Man stories, but it still maintains its own originality that hadn't yet been so well explored in cinemas and that must stand on its own two feet with the ""DC Elseworlds"" seal on upcoming new DCU in theaters to be led by James Gunn.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,

I don't understand why they would chose someone who looks like he's going through puberty to play such an iconic character. Robert, please step away from playing any superhero characters in the future. You've ruined the reputation of an amazing character. Aside from the huge eyesore throughout the movie, I believe this film had a great story line.

6595b4dba783f0cdafc9af36,tt1877830,The Batman,smokemaster-81979,26 December 2023,1,"Title: A Dark Descent into Cinematic Chaos\nThe recent Batman movie, touted as a beacon of superhero cinema, is nothing short of a catastrophic disappointment. From the opening credits to the final scene, this film manages to obliterate any expectations one might have had for a coherent and engaging storyline.\nLet's start with the screenplay, an incoherent mess that seems to have been cobbled together by a group of amateurs in a hurry to meet a deadline. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, with characters spouting off lines that feel like rejected scraps from a high school drama class. Batman, once an iconic symbol of brooding intensity, now comes off as a caricature of himself, uttering lines that are more likely to induce laughter than fear.\nThe film's attempt at a dark and gritty atmosphere falls flat on its face. Instead of a nuanced exploration of the psychological depths of the Caped Crusader, we're treated to a haphazard collection of dimly lit scenes that do nothing to enhance the overall mood. It's as if the filmmakers mistook shadows for substance, leaving the audience squinting in confusion rather than leaning forward in anticipation.\nAnd let's not forget the so-called plot twists that feel more like desperate attempts to salvage a sinking ship. The narrative is riddled with contrivances that strain credulity, leaving the viewer wondering if the writers even bothered to think through the implications of their choices. Any semblance of logical progression is sacrificed for the sake of shock value, resulting in a story that feels disjointed and unsatisfying.\nThe cinematography, touted as a highlight by some, is nothing more than a misguided attempt at artistic flair. The excessive use of shaky cam and frenetic editing serves only to induce nausea rather than immerse the audience in the action. It's a shame that the visuals become a distraction, as there is little else to salvage from this cinematic wreckage.\nIn conclusion, the latest Batman movie is a train wreck of epic proportions. From the abysmal screenplay to the muddled cinematography, every aspect of this film contributes to its descent into mediocrity. Die-hard fans of the Dark Knight may find themselves questioning their allegiance after enduring this cinematic travesty. Save yourself the agony and skip this disastrous chapter in the Batman franchise.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,
6595b4dba783f0cdafc9af37,tt1877830,The Batman,swingbreed,24 December 2023,8,"The Batman tells the story of a Batman who is one-track minded in his mission of revenge, and offers an emotional story arc of him learning empathy and the difference between justice and revenge.\nEvery Batman reboot comes with a new approach to its aesthetic. Burton's phantasmagorical vision to Shumacher's neon amusement park attraction to Nolan's militaristic hyperrealism, now we have a ""goth-noir"" aesthetic from Matt Reeves echoing The Crow and Blade Runner. It fits and is an engaging world to immerse yourself in.\nThe technical aspects are strongest suit here -- great color schemes and cinematography, detailed production design full of hidden features, an excellent moody musical score which is the most uncharacteristically minimalist of any Batman score (which are usually rollicking), and, most significantly, the best fight choreography and arguably the best action sequences of any Batman film. They are filmed openly and beautifully, without the headache-inducing quick-cut jackhammer editing of Nolan's fight sequences. Here Batman may take out a dozen enemies without a single edit. I'm so happy for this -- I prefer fight sequences to be filmed in wider angles and without edits, and Reeves films this so artfully. The action overall is so well-grounded too by the film's expertly mapped pacing, which still overall feels more like a smooth detective noir that happens to have moments of great action.\nMy criticisms are minor. I did have difficulty adjusting to a Batman who doesn't even put in the smallest morsel of effort into his Bruce Wayne persona. There's virtually no ""Bruce Wayne"" in this film, he's Batman almost the entire time and even out of suit behaves like a moody caped crusader, not disguising himself at all. Pattinson's performance is wooden and his feminine body type is a bit awkward as Batman -- honestly I think Pattinson would've made a better Terry in a Batman Beyond adaptation (he even looks like Terry).\nBut he's not so awful to bring me out of the movie. And I DO like that they've depicted a far more unhinged Batman. Almost every Batman film hints that, without his money and his virtues, Batman would just be another Arkham Asylum villain -- but this is the only film that seems to SHOW it tangibly. So one when the Riddler says that Batman is just like him -- you actually believe it.\nThere is great acting from the supporting cast too -- Toturro as Falcone and his people are the most Scorsese-esque we've seen from depictions of Gotham's mafia. Paul Dano is an absolute force of nature in this film and is perfectly over-the-top. Zoe Kravitz is the most grounded Catwoman we've ever had as she is depicted as sane and in control -- and far moreso than this unhinged version of Batman. And while Colin Farrel is underused and a bit underglorified as Cobblepot -- protrayed as just another gangster instead of a true Gotham villain -- he still disappears into the role (i wouldn't expect anything less from that fine performer, of course)\nSo I was very impressed by this version of Batman. I'm very glad I watched it. At first having a reboot so soon after Nolan's version kept me away from it, but don't let that stop you. This is a fine installment in the Batman legacy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,

Like Mabel's outlash didn't completely make sense or felt out of the blue. We'd only spent like a minute with her, maybe we should have gotten to know her a little bit more. But other than that I don't think the movie was too bad, but it's not anything remarkable either. I just wasn't as bored as other people seem to have been.\nIt's an okay watch, had a solid story. Maybe the father-son and step-brother relations could've been explored deeper, it felt like the movie was just telling a story which was somewhat interesting, but didn't hit the emotional chords for me.\nThere's a little decent love story going on and personally I'm a sucker for those so I'm a little more upset than warranted about this next bit. It's just upsetting that almost ever time Mabel popped it, it always felt like the writers thought we already know all about her, more than we actually do, we barely spent anytime with her but when she's on screen she's like the focus of the movie, her issues. Jenna Ortega was much better than Mabel, she should've been written way better. But in general, I could say that about all the actors, it felt like they thought they were in a much better movie.\nBut the movies okay. It's sort of feels like two movies in one. Maybe more. From all the subplots, you could probably make two or three movies out of it that were more insightful and took a deeper dive into the characters, their lives, their relationships and dilemmas. Instead it's all neatly parked into one forgettable one. I think it should've picked one genre and maybe leaned into it more, making it a crime thriller, romance or family drama, just to give the movie more character. The movie just felt like it's made up of sub plots. I didn't hate it, I wasn't bored, and I've seen much worse. Felt indifferent to it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

You get a good idea about each pretty fast and they remain consistent throughout.\nThis is part drama, part adventure, part crime, part love story, part fishing documentary.

Perhaps one of the big aspects is that it is a feel good movie ultimately and leaves you content at the end.\nI understand if you compare it to THE PERFECT STORM expecting hardcore fishing life simulator you will be disappointed.

The younger brother wants desperately to spend time with the older one and it all starts out great but trouble soon follows.

My daughter and I are huge fans of hers. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of her better films.\nThis was a mixture of the films ""Contraband"", which also starred Ben Foster, and ""Perfect Storm"". Which starred Ben Foster co-star in ""Contraband"", Mark Wahlberg.\nThis film was boring and kind of stupid for the better half of it. It was obvious ""Charlie"" was the issue. None of these problems arose until he showed up. Let's be clear you're going to give up going to Boston Law and have a promising future to be a fisherman.\nDon't get me wrong fishermen make decent money but nothing near what he would make being a lawyer. His brother seems to not have much and he's the captain. Your girlfriend doesn't seem to have it all upstairs if you know what I mean and she's a drug dealer. Following in her mother's footsteps. He should be running in the opposite direction not trying to lay a foundation down. For ""Charlie"" to be so smart he sure is dumb.\nA lot of the acting wasn't the greatest. You could tell apart the seasoned actors from the novice ones. The tale end of the film got a little more interesting but it still was predictable. This was a streaming film you could pass on. These actors have given you other material that would serve you better than watching this.\nThis also goes back to me saying not everyone can write and direct a film.

But even now as an adult, I enjoy this film. The plot is the best of the three (we don't talk about what came after three). I find Home Alone 2's plot just way too unbelievable and even though there are plot elements in three that are far fetched I just find it more watchable now as an adult. The booby traps are also far more funnier in my opinion and I like the idea of him trying to capture the crooks on film using his R. C car, however daft that may be. Plus Alex. D.

As a stand alone there are definite wins for 3 for some of the best moments of the series.\nI like the storyline, it was more fleshed out and suited the cheesy 90s era, from music to presentation I liked that, whilst Harry and especially Marv are iconic I don't think they had much to work with. Here the 4 protagonists are a mixed bag, the leader plays the part well, the long haired guy was presented like marv was and the other guy for me was a bit redundant. However the lady playing Alice was excellent, from mannerisms to comedic timing I thought she made this movie.\nFamily wise it felt more natural, the kids in the original aren't good at acting, the family scenes felt more real yet again the dad has minimal impact, does the writer have daddy issues? Whilst the family is hard to compare as neither did much, when I objectively thought about the two kids, I actually preferred Alex, he felt more of a real kid, although Kevin has a piece of my heart I just felt this was more akin to being a child. Whilst neither are superb actors, this felt more natural again.\nThe pranks felt more realistic where Kevin's Would take hours to prepare, these were more brutal, creative and fun, I hate panning away and not seeing the impact but I guess it would not look great. Some of the ones in this were even better than the big 2.\nI'm unsure about the team behind the franchise and their motive, you read in 4 they reached out to marv who literally tore the film apart and then they just recast him but dressed him as Harry, the obsession with the older angry looking adult who always turns out nice, there's a lot of lazy writing and stale components.\nIf this had have come out under a different name itd be sitting on a 7 atleast.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,,

They were just goons to be dispatched with no sense of peril to John, even with John appearing to have very stiff joints in this film. There were attempts to make us care about the various characters, but these fell flat, as in this film the characters were cartoonish sketches, rather than someone we could have any feelings about.

I had to split the movie over two nights to make it through...and this comes from a guy who will watch Chapters 1 thru 3 every time they're on tv. This was a sad struggle to sit through. The stellar cast was wasted in this sequel. I see many complaints about dancers in the nightclubs or cars around the Arch de Triumph not noticing the kills around them. Since Ch 1, I've assumed this is an alternate reality (like a video game) where assassins run amok around the NPCs, and that is how it is supposed to appear in this version of NYC or this version of Paris. They are not the same versions of these cities if we were to travel there on vacation, so I can get past that. The script for this movie could not have been more than 5 pages of dialogue.

When off duty, they case the department store they work at and rob it on Christmas Eve every year. When they're hired at the anchor store Chamberlain's at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, Arizona, Willie befriends a chubby, lonely boy named Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) and a barmaid with Santa issues named Sue (Lauren Graham). But Willie and Marcus encounter an obstacle: mall security guard Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac), who muscles in on their action.\nBad Santa is a truly brilliant black Christmas movie from start to finish. The acting is terrific. Billy Bob Thornton is incredibly good as Willie. Tony Cox is hilarious as Marcus. And Brett Kelly is tremendous as Thurman. Heck, everybody does great with their roles.\nThe writing is top-notch, too! I'm one of those people who loves vulgar humor. And from start to finish, Bad Santa is loaded with vulgar comedy and sexual situations. That includes Willie and Marcus's heated debates, Willie making out with Sue, Willie constantly yelling at Thurman when Thurman asks him stupid questions, and Willie trying to teach Thurman how to stand up for himself in the face of bullies. The dialogue is top-notch, especially from Marcus. All the characters are also well-rounded and unforgettable.\nAnd let's not forget the music. David Kitay's score for this movie is energetic and pleasant to listen to, and sounds suspenseful when needed. The movie also makes it a point to include classical music, which works fabulously.\nAll in all, Bad Santa is a hilarious and delightful black Christmas movie. If you don't like raunchy or demented comedy, then this movie isn't for you. Otherwise, get a taste of it! You won't be disappointed.

So much so that, having already staked out a new mall for their next theft, Willie's questionable behavior arouses the attention of the mall manager ""Bob Chipseka"" (John Ritter) who subsequently asks the man in charge of security named ""Gin"" (Bernie Mac) to check him out. Meanwhile, as Willie descends deeper and deeper into an alcoholic stupor, he meets a young kid named ""Thurman Merman"" (Brett Kelly) who has his own set of problems--and that's when things really begin to unravel. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was one of those films that caught me totally off guard as I had expected a typical Christmas comedy suitable for the general public. I guess I should have checked it out a bit more beforehand. In any event, for those who haven't seen this movie, let me just say that this film includes non-stop profanity from start-to-finish along with several scenes of a sexual nature. So, it's definitely not suitable for a family night out. Yet having said that, it was still a fairly entertaining film all the same due in large part to good performances by both Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox. Admittedly, like a joke that is told once too often, the profanity got a bit old after the first 30 minutes and caused me to lose interest to a certain extent--as I have never been one to associate crudity as being synonymous to good humor. The thing to understand, however, is that the profanity is the entire point of this movie. That said, while I certainly don't recommend this film to all viewers, it still has some entertainment value, and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,,
6595b4dba783f0cdafc9af64,tt0307987,Bad Santa,ryanholdenmoviemaker,6 October 2023,9,"""BAD SANTA"" stands out like a tipsy uncle at a family gathering - you're not sure if you should be amused or concerned, but you can't look away. Directed by the audacious Terry Zwigoff, this film offers a Santa Claus so far removed from the jolly old elf of yore that one might wonder if the North Pole had a rebellious phase. Billy Bob Thornton, in a role that can only be described as ""Santa after a decade-long Vegas bender,"" delivers a performance that's equal parts shocking and side-splitting. Tony Cox, as his pint-sized partner in crime, proves that mischief truly knows no size. As the world's most esteemed film critic, I must declare that ""BAD SANTA"" is the uproarious answer to the age-old question: What happens when Saint Nick gets a taste of the naughty list? It's a festive frolic that reminds us all that even during the holidays, it's okay to be a little bad.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,,

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9af68,tt0307987,Bad Santa,jimbo-53-186511,4 January 2023,8,"Marcus and Willie are a pair of robbers who target department stores at Christmas time (posing as an elf and Santa Claus respectively). Whilst the 2 men's approach to getting the job done is decidedly different, they are highly successful in their craft. However, when a curious, inquisitive child ends up being a part of foul-mouthed crude Willie's life an unlikely bond starts to develop between man and boy...\nGiven practically every Christmas film is full of schmaltz (which admittedly I don't mine in some Christmas films) a film like Bad Santa is a refreshing change and is something a little bit different. Of course, this alone isn't enough to make it work it has to be funny....and it is....\nThere are several ways that you can look at this film; one it has a mismatched buddy element to it with Marcus and Willie. Their dialogue exchanges, fights, arguments etc are hilarious (though Marcus is the king of roasts as he totally owns Willie in this respect and a later slanging match between Marcus and Gin sees Marcus coming off the better of the two). Unlike some mismatched buddy films, Bad Santa still works even when the buddies are separated; whilst Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox both enhance the film when they are together on screen they can both hold their own when they are not sharing screen time together as well. This in part is thanks to the great supporting cast that surrounds this film meaning that no matter whom is sharing screen time with whom you're highly likely to get some dynamite exchanges (I literally couldn't list them all here there's so many).\nI think what really makes this film work is Brett Kelly as the kid; you always sense that each time he encounters Willie that he is slowly chipping away at his foul-mouthed and crude exterior and slowly discovering the little bit of heart and compassion that exists within this man. What is so good though is the deadpan way that the relationship is handled and developed; no matter what Willie does or says to the kid he takes it all with good grace, he follows Willie around like a lap dog and despite Willie being caught by the kid in compromising situations from time to time the kid never bats an eyelid; it's both hilarious and wonderful to see how this quirky friendship gradually begins to manifest itself.\nI've talked a lot about Cox, Thornton and Kelly, but some of the supporting cast also need some acknowledgment too; the likes of the late John Ritter and the late Bernie Mac are both superb here. Lauren Graham doesn't come off quite as well (though I don't blame her entirely as her character isn't particularly well written and she's treated as little more than a play thing for most of the film).\nIf you fancy watching a very different kind of Christmas film then do yourself a favour and watch Bad Santa; though as the film's title suggests it's perhaps not one to watch with all the family (particularly if you have young children).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b42,,,,,

The child who Santa goes to bat for is in no way believable as a person. His dumbfounding naivete is over the top, and he is nothing more than a cardboard cutout.

Benicio Del Toro is the man - what a performance!\nWhat I wanna mention is, this is one of the few movies that does not do the conventional thing of making every little point in the movie to be important to solving the crime. And in fact, many, if not most of the points that came up are never resolved, but that is life. I'm not a cop but I know that if you are a detective, hundreds if not thousands of leads come in that never really point you to the answer of who done it and that's exactly what this movie does. It has lots of leads that seem important, but they are left unanswered.

Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this groundbreaking film redefined the crime genre and set a new standard for nonlinear storytelling and character-driven narratives.\nFrom the iconic dialogue to the unforgettable characters, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a tapestry of interconnected stories that are both violent and darkly comedic. The film weaves together the lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of small-time thieves in a non-chronological sequence that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its stellar ensemble cast. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and others deliver career-defining performances, breathing life into Tarantino's rich and complex characters. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, and their portrayals linger in the minds of audiences long after the credits roll.\nThe film's soundtrack, featuring an eclectic mix of 1970s pop, surf rock, and soul, is a character in itself, seamlessly integrated into the narrative and adding a layer of depth and nostalgia to the viewing experience.\nTarantino's direction is bold and unapologetic, blending graphic violence with moments of unexpected humor and tenderness. His use of long takes, unconventional camera angles, and innovative editing techniques creates a visually striking and immersive world that draws viewers into the gritty underbelly of Los Angeles.\n""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that demands repeated viewings, rewarding audiences with new details and insights each time. Its impact on popular culture is immeasurable, and its influence can be felt in countless films that followed in its wake.\nIn conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a tour de force of storytelling, character development, and filmmaking prowess.

The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film.\nTarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of ""pulp"". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as ""too demented"". Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\nPulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers.

Given the evidence and timeline there is almost no doubt that she's guilty.\nAnd it's a really nicely made true crime film. The timeline is well worked out. Her life and motives are clearly known, and the family members clearly want the full story told. And it's frequently awful to watch. Just normal ignorance, lack of oversight and questional methods by coroners allowed her to continue.\nAgain I think she did it. But I felt a little uncomfortable that the only 'other side of the story', was some hack lawyer? Perhaps everyone who knows her turned on her. Fair enough. But the counter argument could have been narrated or at least laid out for balance. She hasn't been convicted yet, and even tho she seems completely guilty, it's til proven innocent, so it seems a bit of a hit piece. It kind of takes away from it's integrity.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,
6595b4dca783f0cdafc9af99,tt30177031,Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case,Jithindurden,23 December 2023,5,"An engrossing documentary that moves so fast that it forgets that it's a documentary. Usually, when I watch a documentary, even when it's based on a well-known event, there would be a lot more research that goes into it which shows a lot more information than what the media would've told till then. Here, that is not the case. There's little to nothing in the way of new information that I wasn't aware of before. Moreover, good documentaries would delve into more faults from the side of the police or those which happened at different points of investigation which seemed to have happened a lot in this case but is not focused. The whole focus was on telling the story from a fixed perspective in a thrilling manner. Even though, Aloor is shown as someone who speaks for Jolly, it is not nearly as convincing as it is designed to be. Which itself is not an issue, but when there's so much more that happened around it that is conveniently skipped, which feels almost like it is because it was never covered by the mainstream media. There are so many questions I'm left with at the end, that the overuse of some cinematic techniques makes me feel this wasn't as good as I felt when I watched it.\nThe way Jolly has given some of her statements, and the way her own son talks about her, it is pretty clear she is the culprit even without more solid evidence. But the lack of more solid evidence and the lack of focus on different angles on why that happened is very apparent here.\nOverall as a documentary, this feels like an average affair because it is a cinematic retelling of a known story without any research into new information.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

The first 20 minutes were reminiscent of my experience, the hiking, hand cart, tarps, and camp fires. I entered the program a very selfish, abusive, entitled, brat. My parents sent me to this program after trying everything, after I overdosed I was put on a plane headed for SLC. It was so hard! I hated it. It was exactly what I needed. I credit that program for saving my life. It gave me self esteem and survival skills.\nIn my group there wasn't any abuse, the counselors were great. The food was terrible, salt pork, biscuits cooked on/in the ashes. My favorite ""treat"" was a lot of powdered milk in my water bottle, with less milk than required, left outside the tarps to freeze, a makeshift milkshake. I was there October to December, so it was cold at times. We talked a lot about what we would eat when we ""got out"". We took baths in the creeks, quickly because it was very cold. We moved almost every day, and were taught to not leave a sign we were there. I saw some of the most incredible sights, and met some wonderful people, all while finding myself.\nI believe these types of programs can be very great for some youth, for others it could definitely push them over the edge. This should be a last resort, not a ""my daughter won't clean her room"" punishment. The people leading should have education in child psychology, and lots of experience in survival skills. It absolutely saved me, I'm eternally grateful for it. It breaks my heart that people have experienced torture and abuse at the hands of people claiming to want to help. Having adult children of my own, now, I can't imagine feeling like this is your last chance, you're out of options, and you'd do anything to save your child. To make that decision and find out something terrible was done at the hands of people you entrusted your children to....not sure how you could get past that.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

In the 70's parents were admitting their ""problem children"" into Psychiatric hospitals. The children were there for various ages and reasons from extreme disorder to a simple truant. The only segregation was between boys and girls. Thorazine was over used as well as a variety of other medications in an attempt to control the children. Small 10x10 rooms titled ""the thinking room"" were used for isolation. Keep in mind in the early 70's husband's were still having their outspoken or independent wives admitted in to Psych. Units and lobotomized.

However, as you are introduced in the story, you are expecting a lot more (check out the Netflix documentary Scouts Honor - its a far better one on the similar topic) but you get lots of the same stories told by different people. This would be relevant if they went with proving some patterns or structural issues within these types of therapies, but they failed to deliver any such conclusion worth of social impact. If the goal was to portray these horrible events than they should be covered with more focus and content. Moreover, you are left unsatisfied with some of the stories which ironically prove everything contrary of what the documovie was trying to prove in the first place - for example, parents commenting on the issue of organizers gaining money and them paying for this endeavors. In my opinion, this emphasizes the lack of substance of a 'modern american family' and shows one more time how misplaced people's focus could be. Not to mention that this was obscure notions as these types of organizations really requires significant funds, but it puts out of the place the very essence and rather systematic issue of capitalistic society (that hapiness and child well-being can be obtained on the free market and be left with shock when you learn the harder way that it cannot).\nOn the other hand, I must confer that the underlying concerns portrayed in this docu are extremely important and that's the main advantage of this film.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

It's an incredibly complex issue. In my personal experience I was expelled from middle school in 8th grade. I was a class clown I played pranks and wasn't a nice guy. I was constantly in the principals office. The county sent a letter to my parents at the end of the year that I was required to attend a state alternative school, or an accredited private alternative. My parents went for the latter.\nI ended up in North Georgia in the middle of woods. Think holes but with lumber. The wild part is many good people did work there, but there were also very evil people. While it may seem easy to blame the parents, the sad thing is many likely didn't know. For example we were allowed 1 phone call a week strictly with guardians. The calls were on a delay, so if you spoke negatively (truthfully) they would shut the phones off. Th letters were also taken and not delivered if they said negative things. The program never told us that. We were allowed a visited once every 3 months. My parents came and once we got off the property I started telling them about all of the abuse. They looked at me like I was crazy and I said haven't you been reading my letters? That's when I found out they never received any.\nThe worst part of these places is that they punish you for normal behavior. Assimilating back into the world for me was extremely difficult. I lived in constant fear of the being sent back until the place was shut down for good. On top of that it's nearly impossible to know what social norms were. Things that would've gotten you severely punished happened to be regular day behavior. For years I almost had to pretend to be normal until I could figure it out. The system as a whole needs changed. For some (killers, rapists, drug dealers) it made sense, but for a class clown I had no business being there.\nMost people who have been to a place like this probably don't tell anyone. I just urge everyone to be nicer, you can never be sure of what someone else has been through based solely on appearances. I commend the filmmakers for creating this. Hopefully all of these places are shut down before more lives are lost.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

They are unbearable to live with, using drugs, getting in trouble at school and with the law."" Let them have some consequences by being out in the wilderness. I felt for the parents. I have raised teenagers and at times, I really felt helpless and completely disrespected. A prisoner in my own home and treated like a criminal by my own children.\nBut then, a poor girl dies...of course from the extreme weather conditions she endured in this camp. Not close to any medical help. And Steve Cartisano says he is not responsible. His wife says he is not responsible. How could he be? He wasn't there? At this point I'm screaming at the television. How obtuse? How stupid? How entitled?\nSomehow, with a high profile attorney, he beats the charges of negligence causing death. Instead of sailing off into the sunset, he opens another camp ""on the water."" He doesn't have permission to dock on the islands that he sails to, and again, he should not be held accountable because ""he is never there"". It starts to look like "" Lord of the Flies"". His wife is very sad because there is no more money coming in. His children are also sad because the authorities shut the camp down.\nBut then this Steve Cartisano tries his hand one last time, opening a camp in Samoa, and sends his drug addicted son there. There are reports of sexual abuse. And physical abuse. A video tape is proof. The camp is shut down. The US embassy rescues the remaining kids. Steve Cartisano faces no charges.\nAt the end of the movie, one of the kids in the Utah camp, I believe, accuses Steve Cartisano of fondling her breasts. She was only a teenager. Her mother does not pursue legal action against Cartisano, thinking it will stop him from helping kids. So sick.\nI couldn't help but think that karma came for Cartisano. He died very young of colon cancer, his son who was a drug addict is currently in jail, and his clueless daughter ( she couldn't understand why the authorities were coming after her dad....) also had a rough time on drugs.

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9afa9,tt28814949,Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,Boristhemoggy,20 December 2023,10,"Taylor Swift is probably the best artist in the world and I can't see her being beaten anytime soon. I do believe that I have just watched the greatest show ever made.\nIt's fine if you are not a fan of pop music, or blondes, or women, or indeed just her. But no-one can deny that her shows are superlative.\nThe Eras final US stage show opens with an aerial view of the 100,000 seat SoFi stadium in Los Angeles, and the camera dips to enter the stadium and show a packed out venue, with a stage almost half the length of the stadium field. The entire stage is also made up of hundreds of screens. Throughout this several minute long sequence Taylor can be heard voicing titles and song lyrics and statements, all designed to build up to the start of the show.\nEvery person has a ticket on a lanyard which can light up and they are all controlled by the musical director. They also have armbands which light up too, and flash with the music. About 80,000 of these lights make the stadium look like a clear, starry night.\nEnormous, 5 metre tall butterfly wings enter the stage in front of the enormous screen, flowing gracefully all the way to the far end where they seem to gently float down to a pile on the stage floor. Ethereal music with hints of Swift tracks plays as these gossamer wings finally settle to the floor, then rise quickly to reveal Taylor, in a trademark sparkly outfit, who moves immediately into the song Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince.\nThe crowd of course erupt with cheers as she appears and thus starts 3 solid hours of spectacular showmanship the like of which I've never, ever seen. She sucks the audience in during a 17 minute introduction to the tour show, with some fabulous tracks and beautiful imagery and non stop energy before she even says hello. By the time she properly greets them, they are all one and tuned into her and the entire stadium including security and venue staff are all in one organic pleasure orgy based around Swift's personality and music.\nAs a way of introducing one of the songs Taylor shows that she can control 70,000 simply by pointing a finger, and long time fans like me know after a few moments what she is referencing. It's her way of leading into a particularly track.\nThe scenes and sets backed up by hundreds of enormous screens, lights and special effects are beautifully done and are worthy of the best sets Hollywood has to offer. The entire concert is worth watching just for the scenes created, and the costumes that they all wear which suit the songs and the scenes. The production value is out of this world. If you watch her backing singers, dancers and other staff during the film, you see a dedicated bunch of guys, highly experienced and rehearsed, all ensuring that their part in the night also goes smoothly.\nTaylor's superpower, apart from being a beautiful human being that is so approachable, is in creating images in your head with lyrics. She has done if for years for me and sometimes I wish I could see a film based on some of the scenes she makes me imagine while listening to her music.\nTaking the freedom to produce her own show, she makes a lot of those images come to life for us, bigger and better perhaps than we could have thought of. Your mind is allowed to run amok as she almost seems to free you of earthly ties simply by singing and showing you her colourful, energetic, surreal world. All the familiar tracks are there, and Taylor moves effortlessly from pop, to rock, to folk, to hiphop, to country and back to rock with such ease that you think there are no genres anymore. Taylor Swift has made all genres merge into 1 giant super-music genre labelled Swiftish.\nShe interacts personally with her fans, she interacts regularly with her backup singers and dancers and musicians. She has no God complex, she has humility and knows that she is part of an unstoppable musical machine, but one which relies on others to help it along. And she humbly thanks us, the fans, for letting her do this. Letting her reach our very hearts and souls with love and anger and joy and sadness and thoughtfulness, in a unique and beautiful way.\nShe makes sure every person attending can see her and hear her, and although she is dancing as well as singing for a solid 4 hours, she barely misses a beat, constantly smiles at her audience, and puts everything she has into singing the songs -not just repeating lyrics musically like a lot of artists do- but actually singing them and putting the appropriate feeling into the lyrics so that her singing matches the meaning of the words. Another thing that not many artists do.\nTaylor covers songs from each of her albums, hence the name 'Eras tour' so any fan at any point of fandom can enjoy something. She absolutely slayed All Too Well, one of her best songs along with 'Long Live'. And yet even her very early songs all seem just as relevant as her latest ones. Such is the power of her storytelling.\nBarely breaking sweat she travels the length of the stage many times and even at one point shocks the crowd by seemingly diving off stage into a 100 metre long pool and swimming to the far end so she can leave the set to get changed. The 4 hours of all of her past hits from the present to her first song passes by far, far too quickly: I could happily have sat for another 4 hours listening to and watching this amazing force of nature.\nThroughout the entire show she commands the stage, and controls the audience, leading them willingly into pleasure and joy in her own inimitable way. She proved that simply by pointing a finger she can control thousands of people at a time, and they love her doing it because she is one of them. Indeed the big studios turned their noses up at her idea of having a filmed grand tour. I bet they're regretting it now that she followed her instincts for what her fans want and did it anyway, for them.\nTaylor Swift, despite her flaws and wholesome humility, has become a living legend, easily witnessed by her rise to super stardom and the unwavering passion of her fans: men and women, old and young. And I believe that she has changed not just music, and not just showmanship forever, but also taught us what it's like to be a great human.\nI give this show my first ever 10, and I'd give it more if I could.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,

The actual songs are very dime a dozen boring, mundane, nothing memorable. One sounds basically the same as the next. Considering this is probably the biggest money making tour in history, it's remarkable it takes so little to be a rich & famous performer. Most of the songs are just speaking words while making some droning sounds that give the allusion of singing. She doesn't have a good voice really.

Just about every other artist in the world does though! From what I saw and already know, her songs are all negative.

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9afb2,tt6442978,Mommy Dead and Dearest,paul-allaer,12 July 2019,8,"""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" (2017 release; 82 min.) brings the story of Gypsy and her mom DeeDee. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Waukesha, June 15, 2015"", and Gypsy is being interviewed by a police officer about her possible involvement in DeeDee's brutal murder. Gypsy denies any involvement. We then go to ""Six Years Earlier"" as we see Gypsy and DeeDee onstage somewhere, with Gypsy singing a song while in a wheelchair, to wild acclaim from the audience. Gypsy looks strangely different. The documentary then goes to ""Springfield, MO"" where Gypsy and DeeDee eventually had settled... At this point we're 10 min. into the documentary. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\nCouple of comments: this documentary is from director-producer Erin Lee Carr, and in just a matter of a few years, she has been making a name for herself as one of the leading documentarians in this country. (In 2019, she released the top-notch ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"" as well as the riveting ""I Love You, Now Die""). In ""Mommy Dead And Dearest"", Carr looks at a case of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy (where a caretaker--usually a mother, makes up health problems of another person--usually a child) that is so wild and so unthinkable that if this weren't a real life case, you simply wouldn't believe it. Gypsy's list of alleged illnesses (including being paralyzed from the waist down) is longer than a grocery list when your kitchen needs restocked. What I kept thinking was: how did these hospitals not see through this? ""Everyone failed (Gypsy), literally everyone,"" comments someone. Please note that the director was able to snag a long one-on-one interview with Gypsy, just watch... And I admit that at the end of the documentary I welled up. Here's hoping that Gypsy eventually will get an opportunity to ""live a normal life"".\nThis film originally came out on HBO two yeas ago, and I recently saw it on HBO On Demand. So glad I sis. If you love a investigative documentaries, do yourself a favor, and check out ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"", and any other work from director Erin Lee Carr.

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9afb4,tt6442978,Mommy Dead and Dearest,Hallelujah289,11 May 2019,5,"""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well-edited and put together film. It tells the narrative behind the Gypsy Rose Blamchard case in a coherent way, and it introduces the viewers to most pertinent characters to try to get a complex overview of this bizarre case. The directors succeed in trying to present the case in an objective way, talking to family members, police officers, lawyers, doctors and psychologists alike, but nonetheless there is still a problematic bias in this documentary as well an odd and conflicting ambivalence, as if the filmmakers both oversimplified and overcomplicated their narrative at different turns. These insidious manipulations aggravate an otherwise technically proficient documentary, which is nonetheless likely to be one of the better ones out there. Despite the notion of a happy ending ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives, I have a feeling there is more to complicate the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.\nViewers note that while Gypsy Rose Blanchard has been given ten years prison time, the man she asked to murder her mother Dee Dee for her, Nicholas Godejohn, has been given a lifetime sentence and Gypsy is effectively done with him. Psychologists interviewed within the film have given Gypsy the doubt of bein a sociopath, and while I appreciate how the filmmakers didn't shy away from that I question whether they haven't manipulated events (the family reunion with Gypsy's father) in too much favor for her. If they haven't, then just be aware that the something here is still pretty messed up, and the answer ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives is far too pat.\nEven still, ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well told, but probably premature documentary, and I don't believe it's the full story it is made out to be. Some kudos to the filmmakers for making some notion of possible discrepancies, apthough not going far enough in exploring them so as to feel fully fledged or complete.\nMixed feelings about this one.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

This is a documentary. I know Jon Batiste only through ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"". My surface take on him is radical positivity. It's more than being Ed McMahon. He seems like a guy who reacts with a smile no matter what the situation. This movie lets the audience a peek inside the curtains. There are moments. There are big moments of anxiety and doubt and depression. It may be small little peeks, but they are enough to paint a picture of the man and his relationship with his wife.

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9afbb,tt28865980,American Symphony,rickchatenever,17 December 2023,8,"2022 was the best of times, the worst of times for Jon Batiste and Suleika Janouad.\nBoth. Everywhere. All at once. In every moment.\nIt was the year the couple married. It was the year Jon left his high-profile gig leading the band on The Late Show with Steven Colbert. He would go on to win five Grammys, including the coveted Album of the Year, which hadn't been won by a Black artist in more than a decade.\nAlthough Suleika's bestselling ""Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life Interrupted"" would be acclaimed as one of the best books of the 2022, she would spend most of the year in hospital beds, receiving chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and other treatments for the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia, a rare condition that had first stricken her a decade earlier.\nOn September 22 of that year, Jon Batiste premiered his ""American Symphony"" in Carnegie Hall. His wife was in the audience.\nThese events provide the framework for Matthew Heineman's powerfully affecting documentary that shares the title of Batiste's musical creation. Its Higher Ground production company was created by Michelle Obama and her husband in 2018 with the goal of lifting diverse voices in the entertainment industry. It's playing on Netflix.\nIt feels meant to be, writing about ""American Symphony"" after recent blogs reviewing ""Maestro"" and ""American Fiction."" They have a lot in common. Like ""Maestro,"" it presents a loving marriage of creative giants, the husband fulfilling his artistic genius, the wife beset by setbacks and pain beyond belief.\nLike ""American Fiction,"" it focuses on a brilliant Black artist staking his creative claim in a society built on a foundation of the enslavement of his race. (The similarity of the films' titles is unfortunate, confusing and diluting each's powerful impact during this awards season.)\nExcept, unlike the other two films, ""American Symphony"" doesn't have actors. It has the actual people. They're not acting, they're living their lives.\nFilmmaker Heineman is the third member of their marriage, capturing an intimacy that rarely makes its way to the screen. He's there with them in their bedroom or her hospital bed, as they grapple with everything coming their way. In one light-hearted interlude, Suleika takes Jon to the snow. He has never sledded before. We ride down the hill with them, lost for a moment in giddy, silly escape.\nBut not for long.\nPain, isolation and discomfort are givens in Suleika's illness. What's not expected is the resilience, philosophical strength and occasional bursts of humor she finds to face them. In her bed she starts painting giraffes. They quite good, actually.\nBy her side supporting her, Jon is also up against a different set of challenges. Scion of a New Orleans musical dynasty, his gifts transported him to Juilliard en route to a rarified place in the musical hierarchy where fame itself may become his greatest danger.\nHeineman - and his three co-cinematographers - transport us into his brain, recording telephone sessions with Jon's therapist flowing into voice-over commentary that unflinchingly probes his artistic process, and the insecurities besetting artists no matter how much acclaim they achieve.\nThe documentary was filmed in the time of Covid, but finds endless expressiveness in its characters' eyes. When they remove their masks, their faces are visually striking element in the film's grand design. Jon's smile is sunshine; his dance moves are joy itself.\nThe creation of Batiste's symphony provides a plot of sorts, as he mines deep ore in all the cultures that have produced ""America,"" beginning with the Indigenous people who were here when the Whites arrived, bringing the Blacks in chains a short time later. He melds their sounds into a musical masterwork that defies labels - classical, jazz, roots, blues, bebop, hip-hop and a hundred others - because it's them all.\nBut the film's real symphony isn't just the music. It's the two people/ at the center of the story, bravely leading us on this wondrous journey into their souls.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

Feeling expressed as action, music, words, thoughts. It is a heavy burden to carry. This film portrays all of this so well that you feel what is happening. You do not just watch it.

6595b4dca783f0cdafc9afc2,tt28865980,American Symphony,brentsbulletinboard,30 November 2023,8,"Creating a great work of art is very much like creating a heartfelt, loving relationship. Both take work and commitment, both in good times and bad. The challenges can be difficult, but the rewards can be incalculable. Learning how to successfully maneuver through them, as well as how to strike a harmonious balance that keeps both ventures moving forward, is a skill that takes an array of abilities and aptitudes s to master, but, as documentary filmmaker Matthew Heinenman's latest so deftly illustrates, it's an attainable goal, the prevailing highs and lows notwithstanding. The film follows the extraordinary year experienced by musician/composer Jon Batiste and his wife, best-selling author Suleika Jaouad. In 2022, they came face to face with both ends of the spectrum of life. Batiste, an artist with an impressive musical range and repertoire, was reaching new heights in his career, winning five Grammy Awards while serving as band leader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and seeking to complete work on an ambitious composition aimed at reflecting the breadth of our national music, diversity and culture, American Symphony. At the same time, though, Jaouad suffered a recurrence of the cancer she battled a decade earlier, an illness she chronicled in writings that would come to launch a career; now, after a 10-year remission, she was facing a second, potentially risky bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, not to mention an uncertain future. With such seemingly polar opposite fates befalling them, Batiste and Jaouad struggled to get through their respective challenges while keeping their love and art alive, putting their successes into perspective in light of what they were up against otherwise. This intimate, heartstring-tugging documentary gives viewers a candid, up-close look at what a truly loving couple can experience under such diverse, trying and bittersweet circumstances, but without becoming manipulative or melodramatic. This beautifully photographed story provides an unfiltered depiction of the range of emotions that each partner goes through, particularly when it comes to its depictions of the philosophical insights observed by each of the spouses. It also showcases Batiste's wide-ranging musical styles, both in his performances and in his composition process. Admittedly, a few of this offering's sequences meander a bit, but the overall production is skillfully edited and sensitively portrayed. ""American Symphony"" is a beautifully moving film, one that reinforces what matters most in life and what makes it worth living, during both good times and bad, as long as we have each other to make our way through it, bringing new meaning to what our marriage vows are ultimately all about.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

Naked women in South Estonia spend time in a sauna sharing their secrets and pains and thus ritualistically cleansing themselves of them. An interesting concept, I would say especially for young people who have not been exposed to these kind of stories or had never had the opportunity to feel understood by peers and might learn something. There is some beautiful scenery and traditional and mystical rituals that are filmed very nicely, too.\nHowever nothing else much happens. If you are in the mood to hear these intimate stories of childhood trauma, love, teen love, abortions, rape, violence, mother daughter relationship, lesbianism, body image issues and so on, this is a great film for you. Yet at the same time it can be considered a loose collection of short female confessions that can be read separately, like a series of blog posts. My wife absolutely loved it. I felt it was not for me, although I appreciated it the format.\nThe sauna in East Estonia and Finland and those areas is not merely a thing you do for pleasure, but has deep roots in their old culture, even pre-Christian and may have roots in rituals in the Neolithic.

They take you into the heart of that place where you're more than an observer but less than a participant.\n""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" achieves that feat on a number of levels. For a start I know nothing about Estonia and even less about its tradition of enjoying rustic sauna huts in the wild birch forest. The process of using these shacks has a very meditational quality about it in the lighting of the fire and the gathering of the water. These simple but foundational acts feel so very appreciated here.\nAt the same time this particular sauna is women only and you see them naked and sweating, safe in this environment and comfortable in their own skins. As a man it's quite something to witness these women being so physically and emotionally vulnerable with each other. They're free to share their deepest fears and concerns in this nurturing space and it's wonderful.\nThe film also looks incredible with shooting clearly taking place in a range of seasons. The little light that makes it into the sauna refracts through shifting veils of smoke and reflects from limbs glowing in the firelight. You can almost smell the wood-smoke.\nIs it for everyone?

This documentary is pretty strange and weird, but I really like this film.\nThroughout, the visual presentation and sound designs helps to capture the essence of a sauna, tone, and environment of Estonia. The words expressed from the participants are interesting as they helped to provide quite memorizing discussions about womanhood and their bodies. Each direction felt like the film was taking a half documentary and half narrative type style with beautiful soundtrack and writing throughout.\nThe idea of people going in saunas to have spiritual experiences is quite fascinating.\nThis won the Directing, Screenwriting and Editing award for the World Dramatic Documentary Competition and I can see why. The writing, directing and style of editing is really good and the award was well-deserved.\nRating: A-",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

And since Beyoncé writes, directs, and produces herself, you get something more than just a standard concert film. You not only get a view of the concert itself that wouldn't be possible in real life (really all the concerts on her entire tour because of the fantastic editing work), but you see just how much sweat, determination, and perseverance go into a performance like this. Part of me was mindful of just how carefully Beyoncé has been curating her public persona for two decades, including this film, and part of me felt like I was seeing something new...or maybe I just didn't care because I had so much fun. I'm glad I saw it on the biggest and loudest screen possible, and I highly recommend you do the same.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

The movie was such an innovative work of art to say the least. The transitions, the realness, the quality, oh my gosh what a work of art. The Beyoncé Renaissance film marked a transformative moment in the intersection of music, art, and cultural expression. Released as a visual album, it seamlessly blended storytelling with Beyoncé's musical prowess, creating a cinematic experience that transcended conventional boundaries.

The visual aesthetics are a feast for the eyes, with stunning cinematography that captures the essence of each track. From intimate moments to grandiose set pieces, the film is a visual spectacle that enhances the emotional impact of the music. Beyoncé's commitment to celebrating LGBTQ+ and heritage is a central theme throughout the film. The use of rich symbolism, vibrant colors, and diverse landscapes pays homage to the groups diverse culture. It goes beyond mere aesthetic choices, becoming a powerful statement on the importance of pride and unity. This celebration resonates globally, fostering a sense of inclusivity and appreciation for the richness of LGBT greatness. Moreover, the film is a showcase of Beyoncé's artistic evolution. Her ability to experiment with genres while maintaining a cohesive narrative is commendable. From soulful ballads to energetic anthems, each song contributes to the film's emotional depth. It reflects not only her musical versatility but also her growth as an artist unafraid to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. The incorporation of social commentary adds another layer of complexity to the Beyoncé Renaissance film. It addresses issues such as racial injustice, gender inequality, and the power dynamics inherent in the entertainment industry. By intertwining these themes with her personal narrative, Beyoncé transforms the film into a platform for meaningful discourse, encouraging viewers to reflect on societal challenges while celebrating resilience and triumph. In essence, the Beyoncé Renaissance film is a masterful convergence of music, storytelling, and visual artistry. Its impact extends beyond the realm of traditional albums or films, solidifying Beyoncé's status as a cultural icon. By pushing artistic boundaries and addressing relevant social issues, she has created a work that resonates with audiences on a profound level. This film not only cements Beyoncé's place in the pantheon of musical legends but also sets a new standard for the potential of visual storytelling in the modern era.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

Well I reckon I found something to add. That aside let's get into Trevor himself. I had a bit of an issue with him when I ""discovered"" him. That's quite a stretch actually - he took over the Daily Show, he already was doing shows and stuff. But he was replacing Jon Stewart ... how could he? How could anyone? But whoever was responsible for that decision ... I salute you! I reckon it was more than one person who made this possible.\nAfter a bit of time to warm up to him, I could see the differences ... and relish in them and enjoy them. I may still have some issues or disagree here and there, but that is more than normal ... no one human is the same as the other. And yet he is probably one of the most decent comedics out there. So you will not find too many things that will offend the same way that Ricky Gervais offends with ... Trevor is not that kind of comedian! Take it or leave it one might say.\nAnd I reckon he may talk way too much about Germany and France for Americans ... but he tries to bring some outside perspective to the US ... you have to applaud that. And while I don't think all the points he is making are 100% right, it is interesting to see him expanding and really maturing and becoming more knowledgeable! He knows: you always can learn more! And he does just do that.\nAnd he tries to ""teach"" us too. Not in a bad way - or in the sense of ""I know more than you"". No it never comes of as demeaning.

It's nauseating to watch her exhilaration at hearing the victims after the first thing the victim asked, ""How did you find me?""

The movie is a hard-hitting, if not shocking, but certainly devastating look back to the speechless acts of sexual abuse over many years by her grandfather, and the long-term consequences for the family and the victims. The grandfather shows no signs of remorse, zero, and explains it all like you would explain buying a loaf of bread at the grocery store, To Amanda's immense credit, she does not shy away from the difficult moments, and plows on to get to the bottom of this, including the responsibilities of the people around her grandfather, including i=his wife and yes, Amanda's mother.

Quite the opposite, this was buried deep down and became a shameful secret only part of the family even knows about today.\nMy expectation is that everybody who watched this documentary or is reading this review has experience to some degree, either personally, or with a loved one some form of sexual abuse.

The mother in this story very clearly was medically abusing her daughter. The trail of red flags were so loud and clear when I watched this show I couldn't believe it. I know it's really hard to believe a mom is capable of such a thing but it happens more than we'd like to think. Beata was actually a text book case. It is so clear the ambulance chasing lawyers who represented the Kowalski's in their very successful civil trial had a strategy and it worked. Get this narrative out and play on the emotions of Americans who are skeptical and deniers of medicine and facts. What is sad is this could have serious implications in the real world for mandatory reporters of suspected abuse. Do I think our child protective systems in this country need change? Yes of course.

The film follows the Kowalski family, who are accused of abusing their daughter Maya, who suffers from a rare and debilitating disease called complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The film shows how the family is torn apart by the authorities, who refuse to acknowledge Maya's diagnosis and instead suspect her mother Beata of having Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent to harm their child for attention.\nThe film is directed by Henry Roosevelt, who uses interviews, footage, and documents to tell the story of the Kowalskis' ordeal. The film is sympathetic to the family and portrays them as loving and devoted parents who are desperate to find a cure for their daughter. The film also exposes the incompetence and prejudice of the doctors, social workers, and judges who are involved in Maya's case. The film shows how they ignore the evidence and opinions of experts who support Maya's diagnosis and treatment, and instead rely on their own assumptions and biases. The film also reveals how the system is rigged against the family, who are denied due process, access to their daughter, and legal representation.\nThe film is a powerful and emotional watch that will make you feel sorry for the family and everything they went through. The film also raises important questions about the role and responsibility of the state in protecting children's rights and welfare.

By careful editing the suspense of not knowing what or to whom it will happen is held up until the end. As a result the runtime of almost 2 hours felt more like one.\nTo my taste the documentary is trying a bit too hard emotionally in some scenes, but it works and I did care for most of the characters. While there is some sublime cinematography it feels partly out of place as the rest of the footage does not hold up. The subject matter itself might seem nonsensical to some and the character's true motivation a bit shallow - although sometimes that is all there is.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

I lost my brother eleven years ago and Daniel had me crying cathartic tears of grief.

At least I hope it's a phase. He's really hurting and I can't do anything to help. I hate this. It physically hurts to see your kid in so much pain. And to not feel empowered to do any of the comforting a mother would do, especially as one who shows love via touch. If only my son could see this documentary.

From what I understand he filmed over a thousand hours of his life, and this easily could have been a two hour to two and half hour film and I would've felt like I knew him better.\nOn the upside, maybe more people will watch it as it's reasonably short and since it was produced by his sister, maybe she didn't know what best to include or leave out.\nIn the end it would be difficult not to recommend it, as it is one of those ""live life while you can"" kind of stories.

Instead we get a quilted blanket that is neither too heavy, nor lacking substance.\nNo matter what you believe, this film will make you wonder what if. What if lost things were found? What if the wrongfully removed were replaced? What if the ancient guardians of a cave of the dead had never lost their toy? What if we didn't so easily dismiss the old gods? We don't believe in silly curses and old world superstitions, but Daniel's story eats away at the foundation of those (non) beliefs.\nBut for the talk of curses and premature endings, we're left with a profound feeling of admiration of a life well lived. This film was always about life, and by the end I can't help but think that the documentary has a life of its own. Rarely do people get to tell the story of their life so completely. Here, Daniel and his family get to tell his story as perfectly as can be told.\nDaniel has left me with lingering feelings.

Bombs fall on Soviet-style apartment complexes at a rate of hundreds a day, and the entire landscape soon begins to resemble the aftermath of Hiroshima.\nBut what is most dynamic is the actual impact on the people themselves, many of whom do not know who is bombing them. Astounding. Watching children, pregnant moms, and hospital workers taking the worst beating of all is utterly depressing, but, like all medicine, needs to be taken and swallowed whole.\nOverall, this documentary is one of the most heart-wrenching, devastating, tear-jerking experiences ever. You owe it to yourself to see this to get the full effect, since words can never describe how much of an impact it will have on you.\nIt is a shame that it would only be available on PBS, since that will alienate at least 95% of the population that needs to watch it, but if there is even a smidgen of justice left in the world, the few who see it will tell everyone they know, and hopefully, something will come from it.\nThanks to the brave filmmakers who told this shocking story.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

And yes, we helped, but I won't go into the details. What I could see then, made me feel a lot of hatred towards the Russians. Women and children who were fleeing their country, being threatened by the ambitions of a state, that does not accept the democratic developments in neighbouring countries.\nThe 20 days of filming in Mariupol show only a small part of the crimes and destruction in Ukraine, which the Russian army has done. The film came out late, a year and a half after the events presented, but it is an outstanding achievement, through which the whole world can see what the harshness of war means.\nI believe that NATO made a big mistake by not getting involved in the defense of Ukraine's territory, by establishing a no-fly zone, as Ukraine requested at the start of the Russian invasion.

You don't get too much context, you see and hear mostly things that you'd expect to see browsing a collection of footages.\nThe main feature of the production is some kind of recklessness: the makers spent 20 days risking their lives for getting any coverage out from the city, and also, were not shy to show us shocking images about people who, it seems, were never asked (couldn't be asked) wheteher they find it OK to be on film (some even protest, but end up on the screen anyway).\nSo, at the end, it is a philosophical question.\nIf you believe the perfect documentary is something that makes you feel you were part of the experience it is about, 20 Days in Mariupol is perfect.

Over the time span of the documentary not a lot happens, as it's all based in hospitals. All this footage was really meant for a special news programme on BBC or channel 4 for example.\n2.

6595b4dda783f0cdafc9b01e,tt27629714,Filling in the Blanks,yatnickrd,7 September 2023,10,"""Filling in the Blanks"": Unveiling Paternal Identities in a Modern Tale\n""Filling In the Blanks"" is a poignant and thought-provoking documentary that delves deep into the lives of middle-aged individuals who discover the truth about their biological fathers through proprietary DNA analysis. Directed with finesse and sensitivity, the film offers a revelatory exploration of identity, family dynamics, and the emotional rollercoaster that accompanies such unexpected revelations.\nThe film's central character, a middle-aged man grappling with the shock of discovering his true biological heritage, becomes the audience's guide through this complex journey of self-discovery. Through direct interviews, viewers are granted intimate access to the raw emotions of not only the protagonist but also his newfound brothers and sisters who share the same extraordinary situation. The documentary expertly captures their diverse range of reactions, highlighting that there is no one-size-fits-all response to such life-altering news.\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the documentary is its exploration of the varying emotional landscapes of the siblings. Some are genuinely surprised, while others experience a profound sense of relief, shedding the unwanted baggage of their non-biological fathers. Amidst these disparate reactions, one common thread emerges - the unwavering love and dedication of their mothers, regardless of the paternal complexities. This underscores the powerful and enduring bonds that tie families together, transcending the boundaries of biology.\nAs the narrative unfolds, the film deftly navigates the multifaceted layers of the human experience. It shines a spotlight on the societal shifts and attitudes of the past, specifically addressing the reluctant acceptance of artificial insemination during the 1960s. This contextual backstory adds depth to the broader discussion on identity and challenges our perceptions of family structures. The filmmakers are careful to present a balanced portrayal, allowing the audience to ponder the complexities and ethical considerations surrounding artificial insemination.\nAn engaging and heartwarming subplot centers around the siblings' journey to connect with their biological father. The documentary captures their excitement and trepidation as they embark on this unique quest for self-discovery. The genuine warmth and openness of the biological father as he welcomes his newfound children into his life provide a touching counterpoint to the initial shock of the revelations. His willingness to share his medical history and personal experiences helps foster a sense of closure and understanding for the siblings, who yearned for a connection that had been concealed from them for so long.\n""Filling in the Blanks"" excels in its ability to provoke introspection and dialogue on sensitive subjects. It raises important questions about the timing and necessity of disclosing the truth in cases of artificial insemination, highlighting the evolving perspectives on transparency and the potential impact on individual well-being. The documentary serves as a catalyst for conversations surrounding family secrets, the evolving nature of family structures, and the significance of genetic ties.\nIn conclusion, ""Filling in the Blanks"" is a captivating documentary that masterfully captures the complexities of identity, family, and the profound impact of newfound revelations. With its insightful storytelling and candid interviews, the film prompts viewers to reflect on their own perceptions of family and the power of genetic connections. By shedding light on the deeply personal experiences of the characters, the documentary succeeds in its mission to illuminate the intricate tapestry of human relationships and the transformative power of truth.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

This movie is a must see to any one who has done DNA testing and found surprises once the results comes back.

I do believe that for all those people that are experiencing DNA surprises, this documentary will help you understand, forgive, reconcile.\nAt time Jon Baime sense of humor reminded me of Seinfeld.

Dull! Dry! Boring! And the information that was presented in it was so haphazardly thrown together and strewn about it was unbelievable!

Touchy feely, or factually based).

Through something called ""Unreached People"", he sets his sights on the 200 or so resident on the North Sentinel Island, one of the most isolated spots on earth (in the Bay of Bengal)...\nCouple of comments: this is the second documentary from co-directors (and real life husband and wife) Jesse Moss and Amanda McBain (""Boys State""). Here they reassess the life and times of John Chau, the evangelican Christian whose mission went horribly wrong. Of course it raises the issue of the assumed superiority by (almost always white) people who are determined to show the rest of the world how it's done and how to live a proper and meaningful life. The thought that maybe, just maybe, this is just insanely arrogant, if not worse, doesn't even enter their universe. All of these themes were also examined in another documentary from earlier this year called ""Savior Complex"", and frankly better than in ""The Mission"".

Does it represent a quest for the fulfillment of one's spiritual potential or a euphemistic cover for an inflated sociopathic ego? And, in either case, is it even possible to distinguish the two? Those are legitimate questions in the case of 26-year-old fundamentalist Christian missionary John Chau, who disappeared and was presumed dead in 2018 while attempting to spread the word of Jesus to the reclusive indigenous residents of North Sentinel Island, an Indian protectorate in the Bay of Bengal. The locale, one of the world's most difficult destinations to reach and one that's strictly off limits to outsiders, is home to an obscure, little-known tribe with a reputation for being mistrusting of and unwelcoming to strangers. Yet Chau was convinced that it was his destiny to convert them to Christianity no matter what, even at the cost of his life, a concern that worried his family, friends and seasoned missionaries who had attempted comparable initiatives with native people in other parts of the world. It was an effort that raised questions about Chau's motivations: Was he a committed religious zealot who truly wanted to spread the word of Christ, or was he suffering from a maniacal Messiah Complex hell-bent on testing the limits of his courage, hubris and personal capabilities? Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss seek to answer these and other thorny questions about this enigmatic individual whose real intents may never really be known, leaving lingering doubts and pain about his mission in the minds of those who knew him. Thanks to unprecedented access to Chau's kindreds, as well as his recovered diaries, the filmmakers tell a captivating tale about his experience, along with thought-provoking ethical examinations about the nature and propriety of missionary work in connection with indigenous societies. Should it continue? Is it appropriate for Westerners and devout Christians to interfere in the spiritual lives of those who adhere to alternate viewpoints? Indeed, are these people genuinely in need of being ""fixed,"" regardless of the alleged nobility behind the intentions of those seeking to carry out these transformations? ""The Mission"" offers viewers a delicately balanced view of these notions, prompting even the most dedicated disciples of this work to step back and take a new look at what they and their peers are carrying out. It also presents an eye-opening discussion of this subject, encouraging us to ask ourselves, how much is too much when it comes to missionary work, regardless of the religion involved? And when is it appropriate to leave things as they are for those who already appear to be happy and contented in their lives and beliefs?

It's a question that the most adventurous among us ask themselves. John Chau was certainly an adventurer. He ran marathons, loved hiking through forests, and enjoyed rock and mountain climbing. His dream was to venture onto the North Sentinel Island and introduce Jesus to the island's sole inhabitants. The Sentinelese are an isolated human community of hunter-gatherers who have made it abundantly clear over the years that they do not welcome outside visitors.\nIn 2018, when the news report hit that 26-year-old John Chau had been killed while trying to make contact with The Sentinelese, my initial and immediate reaction was to call him an arrogant jerk who probably got what he deserved. Co-directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss, through National Geographic Documentary Films, have brought us more of John Chau's story so that we (me) can better understand his motivation and how it fits into the historical aspect of missionary work.\nMcBaine and Moss explore the various stories here, which include: a community of folks living life on their own terms, the overreach of religion, the role of missionaries, a young man wanting to make a difference, and a father-son relationship. Much of John's story is taken directly from the journal he kept right up until the day he died. The directors also effectively use the letter from John's father, which is read aloud and displayed through animation. Additionally, there are interviews with John's friend, an historian, and a long-time missionary. We learn that as a kid, John was attracted to stories such as ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Tintin"", as well as drawing inspiration from movies like END OF THE SPEAR. His attraction to adventure began at an early age, and it was the draw of religion that really struck a chord.\nAs a Chinese-American and evangelical Christian, it is said that he might have believed the indigenous people were waiting for him to bring them The Truth. Whether he believed this or instead simply felt it was his responsibility, speaks to a level of conceit rarely seen outside of religion or politics. What is abundantly clear is that as a disciple of 'The Great Commission', John's radical approach paid little mind or respect to the uncorrupted culture of this isolated tribe. This is why, as his long-time friend describes, he had to pay pirates to take him uninvited to the island to talk about Jesus. It's a conceit that will not compute for me, regardless of his religious beliefs.\nNorth Sentinel Island is part of the Andaman Islands (where the legend of King Kong took place) and it is protected by the government of India. John Chau's ""Plan"" even included a section detailing the illegality of his mission. The filmmakers structure the film with the first hour being mostly background and setup, while the final 45 minutes dig into John's trip to the island - a trip best described in the movie as 'idealism masquerading as God's will.' John's father carried a burden of parental guilt, which is understandable; however, most of this boils down to John's own ignorance and conceit. As thorough as the research is, and as interesting as the history is, none of it has changed my mind about John Chau.\nOpens October 27, 2023 in theaters.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b43,,,,,

No feeling. Scenes are lit like a TV-studio. Dialogue seems to be written in one day. Acting is okay, but falls flat without anything else pulling the movie forward.

Standing and talking about nothing, as if on a theatre stage, in the interiors of a modern house. The house is really impressive. A good advertisement for architects. In fact, it started out as such - a whole , long advertising session for the House. And the rest is rubbish - the direction, the absurd script, the tragic music and the plastic acting. The couple's relationship was more like a business duo than a loving family.\nThe old commercial formula that the viewer will be tempted by candy paper and aggressive advertising no longer works.

First, they feature well-known Hollywood A-listers, often Oscar winners or nominees. These familiar faces are the hook, drawing you in with the promise of a performance reminiscent of their past successes.\nSecondly, these movies dabble in somewhat original plots, touching upon deeper themes like alienation or globalization, or exploring less common timeframes and cultures. This aspect serves as the pull, intriguing enough to keep you engaged.\nHowever, the common downfall lies in the script. Good cinematography, casting, and production values are all present, but the narrative often falters. Characters are shallow and lack clear motivations. Story arcs feel incomplete, and the endings often leave much to be desired.\nThis pattern leads me to wonder: Is this a deliberate strategy? Are these films designed to leave viewers unsatisfied, driving them to continue searching for something more fulfilling on the platform, thus increasing their watch time?\nIt seems like Netflix movies might be intentionally presenting mediocre scripts in an attractive package.

The same can be said about the Ode to Joy or The Wizard of Oz. Like those things, It's a Wonderful Life has endured and been enjoyed because of its greatness. Its themes are timeless--that of the importance of family, of friendship, of supporting each other, of caring about each other, of learning about what really matters. The acting, writing, cinematography, and directing are all excellent. The best acting in the film belongs to the great James Stewart, in his most memorable role. His George Bailey is wonderful. We see in him all that a man can experience--joy, sorrow, love, hate, fulfillment, disappointment, despair, hope. We see what a good, caring, decent man he is. We see the effect he has on other people, and we see him learn just how important he has been to those people.\nOne thing I want to address is the idea that George ""sacrificed"" to have the life he has. I would argue that he no more sacrifices than parents do when they give up certain things to have children. In the end, what he did and what he has is according to the things he values most, and that's no sacrifice. Suppose Clarence had said to him ""George, I will give you the life you said you wanted. You will be a world traveler who builds bridges and plans cities. You won't put down roots, and you won't be part of a community that cares about you. Most importantly, you will never marry.

The reimagined film takes adaptations from the play with great visuals and songs to accompany it. Oh and the songs, they the perfect length - they get you moving but don't overstay their welcome.\nDisclaimer, I love the original 1985 film adaptation from Quincy Jones and Steven Spielberg. In that film you feel the characters and their sorrows which makes the ending all the more sweet! In this version there is more depth to the characters, it is not a bitter and there seems to be more understanding or forgiveness.\nNow there are many things I enjoy in the original screenplay much better but this film does do somethings to freshen the characters and perhaps even portrays them better. The Sophia and Harpo story is much better told here. Sofia's made a bigger character as she faces so many ups and downs. For my money Danielle Brooks steals the movie with her interpretation of Sofia! The second thing that really shined for me is the reimagined relationship between Celie and Shug, in the original movie it was done with much more undertone and Mister seemed not to notice but you will have to see how different this film portrays it and if you're like me you will think it was done justice. The final big thing I thought this film did better than the original was the portrayal of Mister. Mister is a deeper character here and perhaps you understand what life events have shaped him into the character he is, why he did the things he had and his continued evolution.\nUltimately you will still leave the theater happy to visit the characters you know and be uplifted in retelling of their story with some lines you recognize and others you will be wanting to quote tomorrow.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

I feel it's a bit sacrilegious to say it wasn't my favorite movie. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I will tell you why, spoiler free!\nFirst the good- the acting, cinematography & production were stellar! Costume & set design were top notch & the vocal performances were great. I LOVE Danielle Brooks and honestly wished she was on screen more (more into that later). Fantasia's acting performance was great, as was the rest of the cast. Colman Domingo, who played Mister, was good too.\nNow the bad... ok, so this is a musical, which isn't an issue but I feel that part of the story was lost/glossed over, especially Celie's & Sophia's strife, for the sake of song & dance. I never read the book, nor saw the Broadway production so I can't only compare it to the Spielberg 80's production, which (I may add) is one of my favorite movies. I feel a hard time connecting with the characters and their story seemed to have gotten diminished. I think another 30 minutes could have easily been added to the movie to help with character development instead of displaying year stamps to show the passing of time. It felt too play-like in some parts too.\nCelie had a messed up life (putting it mildly to avoid spoilers) which you kinda felt it but not really. Her story felt very rushed with a quick conclusion that felt a bit weak to me. Same with Sophia. Danielle Brooks is very comfortable in the Sophia role & played her so well, that her lack of screen time was felt. She dominated the scenes she was in but felt her character was thrown in a dark hole to just pop up every now & then to remind you she existed. Taraji P. Henson was good as Shug Avery but even she felt toned down, especially her relationship with the pastor, played by David Alan Grier.\nI don't know... I love these characters. This movie felt like the abbreviated version of the story. I'm sure anyone who has never seen the original (or hasn't seen it in a long time) would really enjoy this. This movie will most likely be nominated for a bunch of awards. The Spielberg 80's production was nominated for 11 Academy Awards & woefully won none. The movie was robbed that year and should have won at least one. Whoopi Goldberg's (she should have won), Oprah's, & Danny Glover's performances are a hard act to follow but those that filled their shoes did a wonderful job.\nThe best way for me to describe the story was to compare it to episodic tv where a problem arose & was quickly solved within the 30 minute episode. Granted, the movie is much longer but there were a lot of problems. It seriously felt rushed. It lacks heart. I ball my eyes out at the end of Spielberg's version, but not this one.\nDanielle Brooks is someone to keep your eye on (loved her in Orange is the New Black as Tastee). I will be rooting for her!\nSo, that's how I felt. If anything, the movie made me want to read Alice Walker's book even more. It's good & I will recommend it to people who I think the original may be a bit too much for them to handle, but I really will push the original film to get a better dramatic tellling of The Color Purple.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b04a,tt1200263,The Color Purple,omarihester,29 December 2023,9,"So the original movie is my favorite movie ever as the story of Celie has been one that resonated with me since the age of 6 or 7. This version not only speaks to the freedom & redemption of Celie but provides an opportunity for MISTER. A chance to change and be welcomed back to the table of life. It also allows us to see how Harpo was a man who learn from his father woes and grow to be a man who loves more honestly and deeply. I feel that for Shug and Sophia it provide the same space for them to express their pains, their needs, and their growths and why. My only critique is that for the first half of the movie they moved it to fast not resting enough in Celie's pain for us to see how she found freedom from within.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b04b,tt1200263,The Color Purple,rgkarim,29 December 2023,8,"LIKES:\nThe Look\n-Modern times means modern technology, and they used it well to update the look of Spielberg's work.\n-This version has crisper images, high definition set pieces and lighting, and fantastic video capturing techniques that really opened up a fantastic world.\n-It's got smoother transitions, the sparkle of Hollywood leaking out and a solid style that speaks volumes for helping add that modern attitude they were shooting for from the trailers.\n-Throw in great settings to help open up the old time world, and you accomplish the feeling of being back in the times and becoming a part of the cultural drama this piece is.\nThe Cinematography\n-Beautiful work on this one, The Color Purple finds some of the perfect shots to make the world come to life and add that sustenance to the scene.\n-Lighting and shadow work dance beautifully together to give you these shots that just steal your emotional control and make you feel the character's blight.\n-Other elements hold joyful soul and that southern culture of family and friends, a lively spirit captured in moving shots, changing angles, and a continuous transition with top notch editing to boot.\n-And other shots are those picturesque moments that add inspiration and wonder, not moving much, but using just enough touches to awaken that momentous moments that sticks to your mind.\n-These moments are perhaps a third of the heart of this movie for me and quite honestly one of the more theater worthy aspects of this film.\nThe Acting\n-Brooks is my favorite of the bunch. The smart mouthed Sofia is like Minny from the help, but holds a lot more fire, a lot more gumption, and that darker zest that works. Yet, when the moment comes for a softer side, this actress brings that to light and helps balance out the two sides.\n-Henson is just as spectacular as she always does, a stellar sassiness that can be annoying, but when curtailed is a rapier that cuts deep. And this movie curtails it well, gives her the mix of spice and sweet that was needed, bridging so many together. She had heart, emotion, and fun, and just owns the lines and the scenes.\n-Barrino is the star role though, and that woman conveys religious hope and despair to a letter that is stunning. She conveys pain, she conveys hope, and seeing these angles move so much, this authenticity helps add that much needed spark to help anchor us to the messages of this movie. She meshed so well with everyone, and she was stellar.\nThe Spirituality/Message\n-This is a movie that was promised to hold a lot of messages and look at the life of certain demographics. I can say they hit that message hard in this movie again.\n-Celie's journey is a hard one to watch, filled with the same antics of the original, though curtailed a bit to help censor and respect the characters.\n-But the message is there to which we can all learn, powerful moments of spirt, lessons of the bible, and the human will to stand up and reach those points without going too far.\n-Some of these moments are executed perfectly, matching the tones of the first movie, and empowering to many who watch it. Which with those shots I mentioned earlier add something wonderful to the experience.\nThe Lines\n-Dialogue is again adapted to the modern era, courteous and kind at tougher parts, but holds so much of the sustenance of the South.\n-Add the funny lines that hold so much merit, timing, and that delivery to really maximize the words and make them slap as hard as the actions on the movie.\n-Then you start getting to the poetic moments, the song lyrics, the catch phrases, and those signature lines that are beautiful, symbolic and sending the message with the most artistic nature they could.\n-Yes the writing is adapted well with enough of the modernization to have a few things to stand out on its own.\nThe Musical Numbers\n-Perhaps what will a favorite for many, this rendition is going to be about the numbers and the added emphasis they help for those scenes.\n-The songs hold a variety of styles, each one with a spirit, heart, or theme of their own, and each helping sell the emotions of the moment in an artistic way.\n-The dance numbers or performance numbers hold a theatrical flair, not only of the times of history, but yet adding that splendor that La La Land, Greatest Showman, or Chorus Line holds.\n-Add in some of those more dramatic numbers that are about singing out your heart, with the set pieces, the outfits, and the music choices all were expertly crafted to sell the moment.\nDISLIKES:\nThe Plot Skims A Bit Too Much\n-Yet with the music being the focus, the story took a bit of a hit for me, primarily in the way things felt a bit off on pace.\n-Sure, the faster pace meant that we cut through the time faster, but a story already heavily changing with time skip feels a little more disoriented in this telling.\n-The team seemed to build around the songs rather than vice versa, perhaps even stuffing too many songs into one film, that in doing so seemed to interrupt the flow of the story.\n-True, most songs didn't' interrupt it too much, but the original version just had more candor, more put together, with a story focus that was a tad easier to keep track of.\nMore Character Time And Fluid Motion\n-Again the numbers sort of interrupted the character inclusion and focus, with many characters sort of feeling tagged on and holding little worth in the movie.\n-Even my favorite characters took some back seats, the musical numbers sort of shuffling the screen time of people to inconsistent levels.\n-And I just think focusing a tad more on keeping those characters ingrained with their stories better tied to the main one would have been such a great decision over more songs.\n-This way the stories jumps would not be as prevalent if this had happened I think and I would have liked this new modality a bit more.\nSome Numbers Not Needed or Cut Too Short\n-As for the songs, I felt this was another movie that got a tad overzealous with the number of songs versus that finesse that other musicals did back in the day.\n-Many of the Color Purple's songs for me felt too short, too cut, almost incomplete or a sample. Sure, it gave me the emotion and conveyed the feelings, but it just didn't have the bite I had expected like the trailers conveyed, and some of the better numbers had.\n-The Greatest Showman, Jersey Boys, and Disney movies do this so much better and I felt that this movie had a shot at some of those wow numbers that not only conveyed that message they wanted, but also have that replay value for someone like me.\n-That would have been the ideal for me, cut the numbers and pick those ideal spectacular pieces to really drive home the balance of musical songs\nA Bit Cheesy/Preachy\n-I'm not about mocking or shelving the moral lessons, but this movie sometimes gets a tad preachy to the point of undermining the natural delivery they had going.\n-Very dramatic monologues have a presentation that only amplifies the dramatic persona of it and does little for me who enjoyed mor of the natural character progression the original one had.\n-These moments had other members crying, and this will be the key audience, but for me, it just didn't need to go that far given how well most of the lines were written and how good the cast was delivering them.\n-That was the preachy element that didn't sit well as much as I wanted.\nThe VERDICT:\nOverall, The Color Purple's modern retelling is on point with so many things that the modern technology brings to the table. A solid presentation in look and feel, the movie's direction uses so many great elements to produce that emotional drive this movie was trying to achieve. With a great cast to deliver amazing lines and writing, the emotion and the characters jump off the page with a story that hits home and can illicit many emotions. And some of those numbers... just wow with what they achieved with the spectacles they crafted and the multiple layers to which the song plays. Yet, in trying to put so many songs into the mix, this rendition sort of chopped up the story and made the time lapses more noticeable, all while cutting out character balance and that investment I got with the first telling. Throw in the numbers not being consistent magic for me, at least in terms of that complete feeling, and full use of them if they were going to alter the flow. I can handle the preachiness certainly, but these other things needed some tightening up to match the level that my favorite musicals delivered. For the target audiences of those looking for inspiration, relevant stories, and that desire to have spiritual/self-confidence lessons, hit this up in theaters, as this makes for a wonderful group night out in my opinion. My scores are:\nDrama/Musical: 8.0-8.5\nMovie Overall: 7.5.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

But the movie felt flat. I know this is a different version (from the Broadway show) and definitely not a remake of the Steven Spielberg film. And while the music was good, I found it distracting, inserted into the story rather than advancing the story like a musical should. The characters felt undeveloped and ultimately unresolved. We saw some of the brutality of Mister but not his cruelty. We saw kindness of Celie but not her true goodness. And finally the choreography. It was good, if this had been on stage. In the movie, the action of the story stops so the action of the dancing can begin. So it called attention to itself instead of, again, advancing the story without our noticing.\nIt's not a bad movie. It's just not really good.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,

Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable, crafting a visually stunning and emotionally charged film. The performances, particularly by the ensemble cast, are exceptional, capturing the nuances of class struggle with depth and authenticity. The film's dark humor adds a layer of complexity, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating.

The South Korean setting really emphasizes the themes also, especially from a westerner's perspective like mine!\nComplementing these ideas portrayed, the editing and cinematography reinforces the extreme financial differences between the two families. The main house setting becomes almost like its own character within the film. It is modern but also has an undercurrent of isolation, which supports a reveal later in the narrative.\nAll of the performances were phenomenal. As the tensions begin to rise, we can see the clear desperation of the main family. I do not think I could predict anything that was going to happen in the narrative past a certain point. Additionally, the ending of the film is one of the best I have seen in quite a while.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this Best Picture Winner!

From the plot, directing, setting, cinematography, sound effects, and acting.\nThis movie is clear, engaging, and keeps you thinking of what could happen next. Which is not what you ever expected.\nFirst, it starts out by laying out the foundation of the family, their financial situation and personalities. The apartment not even in ground floor. Later comes the Rock which is the curse and the blessing in my opinion. Gave them the opportunities and then chaos.\nSecond the parallel, the other family, a community and class very different than theirs. From being jobless to them all employed in this house. They are servants in a family that is a naive high class family who clearly due to their financial situation, are very very naive. However, due to the financial gain, they try desperately not to lose their jobs.\nAfter that, their personalities change, especially as the father is disgusted by the upper class view and nativity. Every character at this point has his own views that changed. After that the hidden basement occurred and CHAOS!.\nThe story doesn't just keep you hanging, the ending is amazing too. The climax which gets out of control and then the family reunites in the same house.\nSomething I noticed which made me admire this movie is the directing and cinematography. Every single shot and angle is thought of, truly an art. All actors were exceptional. Especially the transform in their personalities.

Also, the symbolization on the smell in the movie was really great. A poor family could fix everything, make adjustments, and live a false life. But he couldn't get rid of that smell. It was the smell of the place where he lived. What they couldn't get rid of was this smell... The name of the movie could even be the smell, really! Because from my point of view, the most memorable part of the movie, that's what it was...\nWhen I was reading reviews about the film before, I personally thought that this rich family would be broken up when I heard the concept of ""family falling apart"". They will defraud the family and pull them to their side, etc. But the family that really fell apart was both...\nAnd there have been those who have said that there are no facial expressions for Koreans or something, I never agree with this. Because they are very special people who pass that feeling to us even with their eyes, their looks... The fact that they do not have obvious lines like us does not make them a failure in the acting sense. Korea is in a really great place in the TV and movie industry. I would also recommend other movies and TV series. It is especially useful to take a look at the Hong brothers' series.\nWhen I saw Park Seo Joon at the beginning of the movie, I thought it would continue in the movie, but then I saw that he wasn't in the movie anymore, but he was the one who started the events -albeit indirectly...

I will not go into the story as more professional writers than me have already done so. However, I will go into what I (a cinema fan) thought.\nThe film is primarily driven by the plot. There is no need for violence (at least for a majority of the film) to keep you engaged.

While the successful live a peaceful life, those with less money are living in precarious conditions. The rich cannot tarnish their image as good people and the poor need to pretend to be from a higher class to fit in among them. Parasite is an obvious criticism, but with subtexts that can generate several debates. The film shines by playing with different genres throughout the plot and carrying them out in an excellent way.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b056,tt6751668,Gisaengchung,ESHSfilmclub,23 November 2023,9,"Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come.\nThe contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b44,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,

I saw her with so much makeup with wrinkles very old looking. It didn't suit her at all and made her look very cheap and odd looking. They should have casted much younger woman as she was 10-15 years older her actual role. She also looked like Gena David and wasn't an appealing look on her (cheap looking). The dad played by Ed Helms (a guy from the Office) looked really old and again he looked way older than should be for the role. Not sure why these pathetic Netflix people cast these actors and actresses who don't even have the proper look nor in the suitable age for the roles. Don't put someone 15-20 years older than the actual role and make them look like they actually are with cheap looking set designs. It makes the movie look and feel unprofessional and really fake. I had to stop the movie and couldn't watch the entire thing as it was too pathetic and decided to watch YouTube instead. They create better contents than all of you combined on Netflix. It is also no wonder it only took Netflix a few months to film this and a few months after to release it on Netflix where a proper film usually takes way longer and cast proper actors and actresses. I mean have you seen Jennifer Garner in real life? She looks really old without all the filters...why cast that kind of old looking woman here?? And why does Netflix categorize this as ""Hollywood"" movie? Let me tell you you Netflix ain't the Hollywood and any movie or series created by you guys are far from Hollywood productions. Just because putting together a few mediocre someone who was married to a big name actor or played in TV sitcoms doesn't make a great movie worthy to call Netflix ""Hollywood movies"".

Yes it's not Citizen Kane but it's fun and thoughtful. The actors are entirely adquate in their performances and seemed to enjoy their work. We enjoyed the many references to other ""switch"" movies and it has a good redemption story where everyone has a. Winning endgame. In the cancel culture we live in it has redemptive qualities. It is humorous without being goofy and thoughtful and deep in character meaning without being sappy or maudlin. There is enough character development to make the story relateable.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b05c,tt14227048,Family Switch,GusherPop,30 December 2023,9,"""Family Switch"" is a Dad Joke that is both corny and entertaining. It features a body-switching movie where a character assures everyone that it's a unique and original situation. The movie references other body-switching films, such as ""13 Going On 30"" with Jennifer Garner as the producer. The film has a sprightly direction from McG, an appealing cast, and a parade of all-star supporting characters, making it a fun and entertaining watch. In ""Family Switch,"" the Walker family faces stress due to losing touch with their teenagers. Architect mother Jess (Garner) and high school music teacher Bill (Ed Helms) are disappointed to learn their children are not excited to see them dress up like candy canes and dance to the Jackson 5. Their soccer-star daughter CC (Emma Myers) shares that they used to make family Christmas videos. The game features a family of teens, including Jess Walker (Garner), a workaholic architect, her husband Bill (Ed Helms), a frustrated musician and music teacher, CC (Emma Myers), a competitive soccer player, and her shy 16-year-old brother Wyatt (Good Boys' Brady Noon). One day, they encounter an astrological psychic, leading to a life-altering event where Jess, CC, Bill, Wyatt, Miles, and Pickles, the family dog, find themselves in each other's bodies. The situation is filled with humor, as writers Victoria Strouse and Adam Sztykiel milk every possible situation out of it. Director McG keeps the pace fast and furious, with Jess and Bill finding renewed youth and attraction at a teenage dance, CC and Wyatt learning about responsibility, and Pickles and Miles getting the big laughs. The game aims to show that it takes drastic action to truly understand the chasm between teens and their parents. The film, set during Christmastime, features a game cast including Garner and Helms, Myers and Noon, and a talented cast. Despite its festive appearance, the film is not a traditional Christmas movie, focusing on the understanding and appreciation of family members. Moreno delivers a strong performance, while the supporting cast, including Matthias Schweighofter, struggles with one-dimensional roles. The film is a pure family fun, with producers including Garner, McG, Lawrence Grey, Ben Everard, Nicole King Solaka, and Mary Viola. Body-swap comedies are a genre where adult actors channel their inner innocent kid and young actors channel their serious adult. Since the original ""Freaky Friday"" (1976), this genre has been marked by true Hollywood artistry, such as Tom Hanks' classic performance in ""Big"" and Jennifer Garner's lyrically funny bedlam in ""13 Going on 30."" However, since then, hundreds of Hollywood comedies have wallowed in a baseline joke of American middle-class behavior, repeating it like a sacred trope. The movies teach us that adults are overgrown children, creatures of impulse and appetite, arrested by their immersion in pop culture. On the other hand, kids move through the world with the verbal precocity and confident observational style of grown-ups, implying that they already are adults in kids' bodies. ""Family Switch"" is a double body-swap movie that reminisces about a fractured L. A. family during Christmastime. The Walkers, a mother and daughter, and their father and son, are forced to switch bodies by a magical gypsy fortune teller. The movie's comedy is weakened by the double cliché, as the characters' lives are revealed. The mother, Jess, tries to become the first female partner at her architecture firm, but finds herself in the body of her daughter, CC. The father, Bill, is a high-school music teacher who misses out on being a member of Maroon 5. He finds himself in the body of his brainiac son, Wyatt. The two kids now occupy the middle-aged faces and physiques of their secretly desperate parents. The movie's humor is largely reductive and undercuts the comedy. The film ""Bust a Move"" is a humanistic comedy that focuses on the struggles of a group of adults and kids who switch bodies. The actors are engaging, and the director, McG, stages the movie with a verve that would translate into something halfway delightful. However, the script, loosely based on Amy Krouse Rosenthal's best-selling children's book ""Bedtime for Mommy,"" is less a smoothly rounded plot than a cluttered, opportunistic heap of situations. The characters' bodies are not different enough, and the movie's humor is wrecked when they bust a move at a high-school party, which should be a joke. The film's success relies on the actors' engagement and the director's ability to stage the movie with a verve. The Walkers discover their family member is a better person than they thought, appreciate each other, and play Bruce Springsteen's ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" together. Despite everyone missing out on their dream, the movie's overly programmatic approach is overshadowed by its worst line. ""Family Switch"" has some amusement but is mostly a wishlist for a better movie. The film's worst line is ""Bein' your dad has been the rock 'n' roll adventure of a lifetime.""",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,,,,,

Its funny and entertaining but there is really nothing new to this story. I gave it a 6 which fair in my opinion. The only reason its a 5.8 at the moment is because the story has been done so many times. Otherwise it might be around 6.5 maybe. The actors work nice together. Easy entertainment for the whole family. One criticism would be that many situations are a little over the top. No way those would turn out the way they did.

Perhaps recasting the kids and the dad would have helped some.

When family members switch bodies with each other during a rare planetary alignment, their hilarious journey to find their way back to normal will bring them closer together than they ever thought possible.\n""Family Switch"" is a very light comedy Christmas movie that's perfect for a family to watch (well it's in the title). To start off, the idea of the movie is not very new. It's the same ""oh no a big problem happened, and something has to change within the family before Christmas so we can go back to normal."" However, it was executed in quite a different way. Throughout the whole movie, I didn't really feel like it was too awkward or too ""cringy"" which is a pretty difficult thing in basically all modern day family movies (although I'm pretty sure some might disagree). Surprisingly, this film actually had its funny moments which I really did laugh to. Yet again, it's a very simple and uncomplicated movie that requires 0 brain power in order to predict every single detail.\nWhat really elevated the movie for me was Jennifer Garner. She's just so natural and good at this role and doesn't really force anything out of it. The rest of the cast was quite good too.\nIf you're a serious movie watcher, I wouldn't really recommend this.

The 1973 version was a mess, with some truly head-shaking script and production decisions that simply made no sense, and I suspect were the result of cost-cutting by the producers. Cabot did fine and David Hartman, too, other than his final courtroom scene, which was atrociously bad, but the rest of the cast were either miscast or never found their roles ... possibly rushing into filming the scenes or maybe just terrible direction.\nThis film was a MAJOR slide down the slope from even that disaster. No Macy's? The ""Cole"" Thanksgiving Day Parade? Bad start to begin with. There's no such thing and people know that. Macy's wouldn't participate in this film and I suspect it's because they saw this anathema of a script.\nOnce again, the Santa is fine and the lawyer is okay, but EVERYONE else is a disaster, from the evil rival store owner to the cold, heartless Mrs. Walker, whose first name was AGAIN changed. Why??\nAnd yes, they changed the lawyer's name, too. Why??\nIn the original, Maureen O'Hara plays Walker as a sensible ""modern woman"", but with warmth. Elizabeth Perkins' version of Walker is a post-NOW ""modern woman"" who is not only cold, but mean spirited. When the lawyer proposes marriage and she tells him, with ice in her voice, that he's ""a fool"", I was done with this travesty.\nThe addition of the ""evil rival chain"" does nothing for this story. In the original, Macy's and Gimbal's are at least friendly rivals, and let's remember this is a SANTA STORY which should be aimed predominantly at kids. The 1973 version lost that thread with vodka in the morning, and this one loses it with a complicated business plot which makes little sense and gives us too many ""bad guys"".\nJames Remar and his female sidekick offer nothing to the story. They don't even bring a real sense of foreboding.\nBilled as a comedy, in watching the first half of this film, there was NOTHING even remotely close to giving me a smile, much less a laugh.\nThis is what happens when lesser talents try to leech the brilliance of original writers and creators. They have no chance to improve on the original, and each misstep does nothing but corrupt what made the original a multi-generational success. Shame on Siskel and Ebert for originally approving this disaster. They got it very, very wrong ... which happened more often than you'd think.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b45,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,,,

He goes down a treat and is soon in their store chatting to all the children. He has an honest streak - he tells the parents where they can shop more cheaply and that's risky for his job! His bosses see a marketing opportunity in his altruism though, and the store's profits soar. He isn't popular with everyone, however, and after a street altercation with his walking stick a his predecessor's head, he finds himself in court.

He is well supported by the increasingly incredulous prosecutor ""Collins"" (JT Walsh) and by Robert Prosky in the judge's chair.

He plays a network executive who is clearly unhappy with the choices he has made, and through the magic of Christmas he is visited by three ghosts like in a Christmas Carol. It is a retelling of it, but one that is more modern, and still firm set in the greed is good era of the 1980s. This film came out when I was eleven, and I think my parents picked up a VHS copy shortly after. I wanted to watch a Christmas movie with my kids, and they didn't want to watch Gremlins for some reason, so I chose this one. I remember every little detail, and the practical effects are amazing. The rotting corpse whose arm gets torn off is still creepy today. It's a pretty dark Christmas film, which leads to me to wonder why were the films of my childhood a bit dark, and now films for children are so antiseptic?",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,

(for the 80's) was a great idea, and kudos with Scrooge being a ruthless, disconnected TV exec, but there was just so much more left to be desired in this version of the classic Dicken's tale. As the film goes on, it just starts to become nonsense and many scenes are just loud and irritating. The ghost of Christmas present was downright terrible and completely unfunny. I had a bit of difficulty following the film as it was all over the place and it felt like it's was just jumping from scene to scene without any direction. The biggest issue was that, for a rendition of A Christmas Carol, it lacked heart. The ending felt rushed and disjointed and seeing Scrooge's redemption, which is my favorite part of the story, was so unsatisfying. All in all, the movie is mostly unfunny, annoying, dull, and rather simple minded. It also lacks that emotion other versions really captured with this story.

The supporting cast are also fantastic with Bobcat Goldthwait delivering a brilliant and again hilarious performance.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b079,tt0096061,Scrooged,fugazzi49,21 December 2023,8,"""Scrooged"" is one of the most hilarious Christmas films ever made but it's surprisingly controversial or at least unpopular among some fans of Christmas movies. Maybe it's expectations. For those who say it's not a literal version of Dickens' story, well, it's not. It's inspired and loosely based on it. Many people complain that the character is too dark or that they can't like him enough to root for him. But this is not ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and Bill Murray isn't Jimmy Stewart. I don't think anyone watching any of the actual films of ""A Christmas Carol"" or even reading the story would say they could relate to Scrooge or see any hope for him.. When asked to help the poor by charity workers, he answers ""If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population."" Scrooge is a dark character, so far it would seem from any hope of redemption that when it comes it's all the more joyful.\nSecondly, ""Scrooged"" is basically a farce and so by its very nature everything is exaggerated. That's how a farce works. If Bill Murray's character had been a mildly grumpy man it would have fallen flat. Everything is exaggerated to its maximum effect. Bill Murray's Frank Cross isn't bad, he's horrible. As the movie begins he does something awful, then he does something even worse, then he tops even that, totally plumbing the depths of being an unprincipled scoundrel. There's seemingly no limit to how awful Frank Cross can be. Murray's deadpan delivery and general air of condescension embody the character perfectly. He plays it beautifully, too: no winks at the camera, just totally straight as the boss from hell. It's his film, he had to carry it and he did.\nThe film was directed by action movie director Richard Donner between ""Lethal Weapon I and II. The production became well known for its general air of disagreement between Donner, Murray and screenwriters Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue. Each seemed to have their own idea of the film, with the writers saying Donner did not know how to shoot comedy and not liking Murray's improvisations, which included the major speech he gives at the end. Donner thought Murray was difficult but admired his professionalism. Murray had not made a picture since ""Ghostbusters: four years earlier and felt stressed by the pressure to carry the film. He also suffered some physical reactions to the artificial snow, but this might have actually improved his portrayal of Cross..Somehow it all worked out. It's a bit long here and there and Fran;s change of heart seems a bit too sudden, but that's what the story is about.\nThe film knocks you out of any preconceived expectations by opening with Donner satirizing himself with an armed invasion of Santa's Workshop at the North Pole (""The Day the Reindeer Died"":). It features an actual action star, then goes off in several other unexpected directions until you don't know what will happen next and that's the general way the whole film is. It's also loaded with unexpected casting and surprise cameos which are all part of the fun. Some of this may have lost some effect as time has gone by and new viewers may not understand some of the references, but it's still a funny film even if you don't know who all the actors are. It also satirizes the notion that any publicity is good publicity, the industry obsession with awards and the quest for network ratings. The supporting cast is excellent, even Murray's own younger brother playing Frank Cross's younger brother James. The film was a hit in 1988, though not a huge hit. Over subsequent decades it has picked up many fans and is now a holiday classic.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,

With hundreds of different Christmas carol films always taking place in the same time period just with different actors or different characters. This movie brings life by making it very modern, at least for the late 80s. Bill Murray plays a film producer working on a Christmas carol film whose life mirrors Scrooge. The ghosts in this film are hilarious and have some of the best scenes, the new plot twists and threads are interesting although feel slightly unrealistic, although considering how slapstick this film is that shouldn't really be a problem. My biggest gripe with this film is I just didn't find it funny, it had all the perfect jokes to be funny but nothing overly made me laugh out loud, bill Murray also shouts a whole lot for some reason.

What you think of this movie depends on how much over the top bill murray-ing you can take. He really is a gross jerk. I feel like maybe he was playing himself. Like his old girlfriend would be so into him and immediately swoon the minute he pays attention to her (right after making out with a solid gold dancer on live tv - haha hilareous right?). It is so ridiculous. In the end he doesn't seem redeemed he just seems insane. Like seriously a mental breakdown right before he commits suicide. His assistent holds the studio at gunpoint (which def isn't funny anymore) while he makes a truly deranged speech while crying. It's more disturbing than sweet. Maybe that was the point. I'm not entirely sure. I guess I don't get it. Now I can cross it off my list. It's like how wes anderson has just got too wes anderson. This is the same. Just too much free reign bill murray.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b07e,tt0096061,Scrooged,snoozejonc,23 November 2023,8,"A greedy, selfish television executive goes through a transition period on Christmas Eve.\nScrooged is not the type of good natured Christmas classic that I would recommend for families to get into the festive holiday spirit, but as a dark, 1980s, yuppie spin on 'A Christmas Carol', I think it works well.\nI think you need to be a fan of Murray to fully appreciate the humour, as it is his performance, ad-libbing and persona that has so much focus. For me he is perfect in the pre-transformation scenes as he behaves despicably bad, yet is still funny whilst doing so. It makes me wonder which studio executives or showbiz moguls inspired the character Frank Cross.\nI think the finale is one of those love it or hate it concepts. Has the character gone through enough of an arc to justify the fairly sudden resolution? Does he deserve any plaudits after all the bad behaviour? If you take it seriously, definitely not. However, in keeping with the parallel to the Dickens story and the comedic tone, it probably needs to happen.\nGenerally the humour has a satirical feel and cynically attacks the commercialisation of Christmas very well. This feels ironic in a movie with a primary goal of maximising profit with a late November theatrical release.\nIt is a typical 80s comedy with certain moments that maybe too strong for children, but then some of the humour is quite juvenile as well. There are moments of sexism that may not sit well with a modern audience, but taken in the context of the era it is fairly tame.\nThe supporting cast members are excellent, especially Karen Allen, Bobcat Goldthwait, John Glover, David Johansen, Carole Kane, Robert Mitchum, Alfre Woodard, and John Forsythe.\nVisually, as you would expect from a Richard Donner production it has lots of great visual moments of comedy, horror and general spectacle. The visual storytelling is strong, plus the art design and effects are great.\nFor me it's a 7.5/10, but I round upwards.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,

Harry is the son of two wizards who died trying to protect him and Harry has powerful magical abilities himself. It's bye bye to his relatives and on to to Hogwarts school for Wizards.

Now these days, a movie like that isn't probably so scary for younger kids than back in time, with time things are getting more and more normal for kids and young. Still, it isn't about the scariness, but about the magic that ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" contains. Based on the book by J. K Rowling, (That I really enjoyed reading) I think this is an amazing adaptation. The story becomes a fast icon in the world, and now everyone knows who the famous Harry Potter is, and I noticed the book shelfs became more empty with time, the book grossing go higher and higher, and I can't really argue, the story is developed so well, in the book and in the movie. But here it is about the movie of course. First of all, nothing is greater than some high quality music from our famous John Williams (Jurassic Park) and (Schindler's List) and the magical and convincing directing by Chris Colombus. The visual effects and scenography was on a fine level, Hogwarts castle is a rememberable building with so many hidden secrets to reveal. The acting was on a decent level, too, but the kids are playing way better than I would expect from a youngster. Harry James Potter performed by Daniel Radcliffe is a good addition to the film and he got into character. Harry's backstory with his parents makes the story even more dramatic and gets a better understanding for our main hero. Harry's two friends, Ron and Hermione, makes them the perfect trio, and they're showing friendship and courage in a good and valuable way. Since they're at school, some bullies got to be involved, and Draco Malfoy was a such a fun and menacing character as a kid. It's the beginning, so it's supposed to be the best one, but overall I think this is just a fine start and a great magical adventure. It's not bad, but it's nothing so impressive that I can give a very high rating. It's definitely a nice script, great acting and music, and something your kid can really enjoy (but for adults this may be just something decent).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,,,,

I made a joke to Jaime, my wife, about how the Harry Potter series of movies are Christmas movies. This idea happened when bringing up Die Hard. Last year, when we brought our daughter home from the NICU, we watched the latter ones. We both had seen them and just wanted something on in the background.\nWhat is interesting here is that knowing how things play out from reading the novels and then coming back a second time to the movies, there are things that I picked out. This does well in setting up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and helping not only us, but him learn the ways of the wizarding world. He was left in the care of his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) after his parents were killed. They raise him.\nNow that he's 11, he's ready to join that world that they hate. There is more to the world than he realizes when he goes off to Hogwarts and meets his new best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also meets his new rival, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).\nHe is quite behind on what he should know and has issues with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). It is fun to go back to the beginning now that I know much more information. Jaime is also more of an expert here, which helps as well.\nThis one isn't working with the budget that they'll have later. The CGI can be wonky. It is also fun to experience a world like this and we are there with Harry who had no idea about it either. This movie does a great job at bringing that all to life. I should also say that we have a great cast here featuring Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Verne Troyer, John Hurt, John Cleese and David Bradley, to just name more.\nNot a great movie but does a good job to start this series off. Another thing that I like is that as the characters get older, what they deal with gets tougher. It stays on a level where they can manage it, which is another perk that it has going for it.\nMy Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b46,,,,,

It looks like she is the target of the venal rare book seller ""Geiger"" but swiftly we realise that that's just the tip of an iceberg that includes not just that blackmail, but another one - with the duplicitous ""Joe"" (Louis Jean Heydt) and then there's the missing ""Regan"" which takes him fairly and squarely into the scheming orbit of the other daughter ""Vivian"" (Lauren Bacall). Soon he's chasing his tail, getting thumped, tied up, shot at - and all whilst he slowly falls for his femme fatale. Who's pulling the strings and why? The story itself isn't the most complex - it's a fairly standard Raymond Chandler adventure. What makes this positively glow are the performances. Bogart and Bacall exude a chemistry that's understatedly provocative. Bacall, especially, uses the less-is-more style with a flash of her eyes or a gesture from her cigarette; Bogart just needs to smile or shrug. It comes alive. The effective use of rain, light, shade and a strong support from Vickers and Bob Steele as crooked henchman ""Canino"" all help this to create an atmosphere of menace tinged with some dark humour and presented via a strong script. Howard Hawks knows how to let his stars get on with it, and he delivers well with this compelling and superior example of Hollywood at it's very best.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b093,tt0043014,Sunset Blvd.,fredrikgunerius,2 January 2024,7,"In what was one of Hollywood's first indictments of itself, faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) offers young, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) the opportunity to stay with her in her lavish, antiquated mansion, where she lives in recluse, dreaming of her bygone days as one of the once budding industry's brightest stars - and hoping that her latest script will give her one last taste of the fame she's incurably addicted to. Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom with shrewdness and doubtless first-hand knowledge. But after 70 years of aging, Sunset Boulevard only fully works on that allegorical level. The rest of the movie, with its looming tragedy and noirish shadows, is a little too plotted and melodramatic to really resonate, despite - or perhaps partly because - Swanson's outlandish performance as the ageing diva. She's a ghost of the expressionist traditions she was brought up in, and she's blind to the fact that she's become a parody of her own screen-persona. As the picture revels in this parody, with sprinkles of black comedy which alas are too slight and far between, it does still create its own atmospheric realm that partly explains Joe's lunacy. Thanks to Wilder's skill and an invested William Holden, Sunset Boulevard transports you back to 1950's Hollywood and gives you a fascinating glimpse into its world of theatricality, decline and debauchery.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b095,tt0043014,Sunset Blvd.,Prince-P,17 December 2023,7,"Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered one of the most biting satires of classic Hollywood. A cruel tale of the capriciousness of movie fandom. In his mockery of the industry's sordidness, Wilder turns the history of Tinseltown inside out. He tells a story where a former silent star plays an aging movie diva. Her butler is portrayed by ""The Man You Love to Hate"" - Erich von Stroheim. And yet Billy Wilder himself hadn't come to America until he was almost 30 years old.\nThe director was born in 1906, in the small village of Sucha, Austria-Hungary. When Billy Wilder was 20 he moved to Berlin where he began working as a screenwriter. After the Nazi Party's rise to power, he fled to the United States. There, Wilder finally ended up in Hollywood where he could continue his career in film. In 1939 Wilder had his first success with ""Ninotchka"", a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. Swedish superstar Greta Garbo appeared in the lead, which, by the way, was her first role in a romantic comedy.\n""Sunset Boulevard"" began life as a comedy. As work progressed, however, the script became more melodramatic than funny. Wilder first offered the main role to Greta Garbo. When she declined, he turned to Gloria Swanson instead. Then, Montgomery Clift was approached for the male lead, but he wasn't interested. According to him, the notion of an innocent young man being kept by a 60-year-old woman was downright disgusting. The part eventually went to William Holden.\nHardly surprising, ""Sunset Boulevard"" became the most anticipated film of the year. The magazine ""Newsweek"" even put Gloria Swanson on its cover before the release. And William Holden's performance reignited his, at the time, dwindling stardom. So, even if the movie was offending Hollywood's powerful moguls, ""Sunset Boulevard"" was rewarded with 11 Academy Award nominations. Billy Wilder himself took home one of them for having written the screenplay.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Norma is still holding on to her past glory days of fame as a silent film star and she finds this easier to deal with having screenwriter Joe Gillis be her companion and, in her mind, more than that. A film about obsession, pessimism, ageism and Hollywood's cruel treatment of stars who outlived their heyday. A MUST-WATCH for all film lovers.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b097,tt0043014,Sunset Blvd.,laurenspierre,7 December 2023,9,"As the movie capital of the world, Los Angeles has always managed to capture people's imaginations. This goes all the way back to the early 20th century, when the advent of the big studios brought about the first Golden Age during the roaring '20 and Hollywood became the center of the film industry. Film became in fact an industry, presenting itself as a 'dream factory', selling to the public the idea of the American dream. This industry was built on bonafide stars, good-looking men and women with whom the audience could identify and who, in their pictures, overcame obstacles to achieve success. Stars like Norma Desmond (or Gloria Swanson, for that matter). In selling the public their dreams, Hollywood has attracted many hopefuls in search or their own American dream. People from all over the world with dreams of being in front of (or sometimes behind) the camera, of becoming the next big star and seeing their name up in lights. Up until this day, Los Angeles is a lightning rod for hordes of aspiring actors/actresses or other artistic hopefuls. Obviously, Hollywood itself is in no small part guilty of sustaining its own myth. Most films about 'the movies' perpetuate this romanticized version of Hollywood as a magical place where dreams come true and anything is possible ""if you just want it enough"".\nSunset Boulevard, however, takes a somewhat different approach: through the story of a would-be screenwriter and a washed-up movie star, it offers us a blunt examination of the dark side of Hollywood, a cruel industry with a short memory that stifles creativity and ambition and is quick to dispose of its expendables. We follow B-movie screenwriter Joe Gillis, unable to sell his work and struggling to make ends meet. He is ready to go back to his hometown in Ohio, when a fateful incident makes him stumble upon the decaying Sunset Boulevard mansion of faded silent-movie star Norma Desmond. All but forgotten by the movie-going public and living in isolation, Norma is delusional, believing that fans are still longing for her and that she will make a triumphant return to the big screen. She proposes Joe to move in and help her finish the script that will propel her back into the spotlight. Initially reluctant, but ultimately seduced by the comfort of Norma's wealth, Joe agrees and basically becomes her gigolo.\nWith its brutal dissection of an equally ruthless industry, Sunset Boulevard doesn't so much deconstruct the Hollywood myth as shatter it completely. It looks into the gaping mouth of the monster, one that chews up its stars and spits them out whenever it's done with them. Former stars like Norma are abandoned, neglected by studio executives and the public alike, desperately clinging to their glory days and longing to return to the spotlight. Norma roams the ruin that is her mansion like a vampire, a relic of an older time, in search of a purpose in a fast-changing world.\nThis the fate of the lucky few, the talented people who in addition were fortunate enough to once achieve such success. For the other 99%, the common suckers like Joe, who are either untalented or unlucky, Hollywood is simply a place where dreams go to die. They are never even chewed up by the monster in the first place, but rather spit out immediately. In the world of Sunset Boulevard, these are the people that end up on a bus home to Ohio, their heads hanging in shame. Either that or they become gigolos for middle-aged, mentally disturbed former movie stars, one false move away from ending up face down in the pool of a broken down mansion.\nGloria Swanson's gloriously outlandish performance is fully deserving of its iconic status in film history. Her histrionics and over-the-top facial expressions are perfectly suited to the (once) larger-than-life star of the silent movie era, Norma Desmond. She gets to deliver classic lines like ""I AM big, it's the pictures that got small."" Or, when Joe suggests that her script needs a bit more dialogue: ""What for? I can say anything I want with my EYES."" The fact that this was a comeback role (sorry, a RETURN) for Swanson, who in real life was one of the grand dames of Golden Age Hollywood and star of many Cecil B. De Mille's films, obscures the line between fact and fiction. This meta-aspect adds a fascinating extra layer of intrigue to her performance and the film's commentary on Hollywood's shameful treatment of its talent. ""Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio"", Norma Desmond's claims at one point in the film, but it might as well be Gloria Swanson herself speaking.\nSwanson's flashiest scene (in a movie full of them) comes at the very end, in an epilogue that is both compelling and deeply tragic. As Norma is about to be arrested for the murder of Joe, she has lost all touch with reality and has disappeared fully into her own dream world. The last scene of the film is transcendent. As Norma comes down the stairs, her descent into madness is complete. A look of insanity in her eyes, she stares directly into the camera, addressing ""those wonderful people out there in the dark."" At this point, I got literal goosebumps. Such a chilling ending, utterly devastating, but perhaps also somehow some sort of perverted tribute to the allure of the spotlight and the magic of the movies? In any case, for me it is up there with the greatest endings of all time.\nFinally, a word on this film's legacy. It is interesting to see how Sunset Boulevard inspired more films to look at Hollywood through this darker, more cynical lens, like The Player, Birdman, or my all-time favorite film, Mulholland Drive. Sunset Boulevard was undoubtedly a huge inspiration for David Lynch. There are little references throughout his filmography (FBI-agent Gordon Cole!), but specifically the parallels with his own magnum opus are remarkable. There are many plot and thematic similarities and even the title is a nod to this film. Most importantly, just like Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive offers a scathing criticism of the soulless nature of Hollywood and the destructive effect that the movie industry can have on ambitious and talented people. The general concept of an (aspiring) actress in search of an illustrious career on the big screen, gradually growing more disillusioned, before finally giving way to insanity, is the same, but being the singular filmmaker that he is, Lynch of course put his own uniquely nightmarish twist on it. With Mulholland Drive, David Lynch pretty much made it a wrap for the 'cynical exploration of the dark side of Hollywood' subgenre, effectively making it pointless for anyone to have another stab at it. However, it is probably safe to say that Mulholland Drive would have never been made, had it not been for Sunset Boulevard (by Lynch's own admission, it is one of his favorite films ever made).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Norma Desmond, once the greatest star of all, has got stuck in the greatness of her glorious past to the degree that she no longer has any connection with reality, and the only thing she is living for is her return to the glory of her past. An impoverished screen writer has the misfortune to end up in her extravagant house of incredible luxury and sumptuousness and is caught up in her dream, which leads him into a blind alley of irrevocable personal annihilation, which when he tries to break out of it at last only inevitably becomes the end of him. Gloria Swanson makes a magnificent performance twenty years after her departure from her Hollywood glory, and William Holden makes an impossible role possible and tragically credible. Then we have all the cameos or icons, like Buster Keaton, Hedda Hooper, Cecil B. DeMille, Anna Q Nilsson and other living ghosts of the silent era, a great score by Franz Waxman not intruding on the action, and a marvellous cinematography and stage settings, but the top of the masterpiece is the manuscript.

Is he a murderer? The version written by satirical novelist, Nathanael West was set aside for this satisfyingly romantic tale a la Hitchcock.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Every scene, every frame is perfectly worked out and turns out to be as intense as possible.\nCary Grant deserves special attention for his impeccable performance as the main character. His performance is so convincing that the viewer is completely immersed in his world and experiences every emotion that the hero experiences. Grant conveys the nuances of hysteria and suspicion well, which will not leave any viewer indifferent. And the scenario moves allow the viewer to guess the whole movie who this mysterious hero really is.\nThe heroine performed by Joan Fontaine is also good. The girl gave a great character. I consider her victory at the Oscar in the Best Actress nomination absolutely deserved.\nNo less surprising is the virtuoso execution of the characteristic features of Hitchcock's style. Without exaggeration, every frame of the film is a work of art. From detailed camera angles to the play of light and shadow, each scene looks as if it was created to make the audience sit at the edge of their seats.\n""Suspicion"" is not just a film, it is a cinematic calling card of the author, which becomes another vivid example of the magnificent work of Alfred Hitchcock. This is a film that impresses with its intelligence, passion and unpredictability. If you are a fan of Hitchcock or just like good movies, then this movie is a must-see work.\n7 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

British men and women would find the free-wheeling Johnnie particularly nasty in his behaviour next to what British men and women were sacrificing at the time. I was very curious that I found no reference to this in any reviews. It was almost as if Hitchcock had set the movie in a very different time period perhaps 1932 the date of the book on which the movie was based. There certainly seem to be some deliberate choices, perhaps dictated by the studio, given that Hitchcock did not shy away from bringing the war into some of his later psychological thrillers.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Well, this movie takes it to the extreme when manipulative spouses create such an atmosphere that every negative event around is somehow linked to the said person. Manipulation creates an atmosphere of distrust that is similar to the ""boy who cried wolf"" - even when the manipulative party is visually inactive, we still raise our suspisions to find links how the manipulative party worked around to achieve their mischevious plans.\nEven us, the viewer, fall into the trap of suspicion that makes us accuse the manipulative party even without any concrete evidence. That just means the movie has achieved in portraying how manipulative personalities emotionally ruin those close to them and what madness lies in the head of the devoted manipulated. I find this Hitchcock movie rather fascinating on the physological realm. Besides the mentioned points, we also get to witness how the spouse experiences inner turmoil between love for her husband and hate for his manipulative ways unfolds.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Fontaine won an Oscar (which was really for Rebecca) for this neurotic, melodramatic, and vapid performance, one which always shows up on those 'worst Oscar' lists. Cary Grant was much better at his part, but the problem is that his character is both unlikable and unbelievable. His wife, somewhat of a simp, ascribes his terrible behavior to 'you're such a boy!' Which shows how old fashioned the morals are in the film. As for Hitch, the pacing is slow, the tone is inconsistent (is it a farce? A romance?

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0a5,tt0034248,Suspicion,drqshadow-reviews,1 November 2022,5,"An early Hollywood-era psychological thriller from Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine as a budding married couple on different pages. Grant is a total jerk from the start, borrowing money from his bride-to-be within minutes of their initial encounter and negging her relentlessly during their awkward first date, but love is every bit as blind as accused and she falls for him anyway. His behavior doesn't improve after they're wed, too-young and in a great hurry, but finally, after some years, she begins to recognize the warning signs. By then, though, isn't it already too late?\nSuspicion is essentially a feature-length protraction of the famous ""girl, don't go in there"" scenes that crop up so often in teen slasher movies. Fontaine's character - the mousey, bespectacled sweetheart Lina - walks straight into a lifetime's worth of trouble, ignoring or politely excusing terrible behavior because she's too cordial to call her husband's bluff. Even when the contrary evidence is irrefutable, she compartmentalizes the problem and pushes it aside. Shut that box of worry in the closet, please, right alongside all the others. The idea, one would think, would be to pile on and pile on until the lies reach critical mass and everything blows up in a noisy, fateful climax, either revealing a chain of stacked misunderstandings or disintegrating the marriage in one manner or another. That's how it plays in Before the Fact, the novel this is based upon, but in the film version a poor test screening and studio reluctance to paint Grant as a fully-fledged bad guy results in a weird, hurried non-finish.\nFor years after its release, Hitchcock would claim he opposed the ill-conceived ""happy"" ending, but there's since been some evidence to the contrary. Regardless, the director lays enough early groundwork to leave some doubt in viewers' minds, even after they've been hand-held through that flat, superficial climax. It's well-composed and acted - particularly by Fontaine, who collected an Academy Award for her role - but ultimately feels hollow and drawn-out, like two acts forever in search of a third. I can't believe she bought that line. Again.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

There is some suspense with fast cars on the small roads, the cliff edges maybe being pushed and glass of milk carried up the stairs. Of course it all happens, and the iridescent milk is fantastic but rather than suspense there is more romance and comedy. Cary Grant is great and amusing, the lovely Joan Fontaine is okay although she really needed to be someone rather plain for this part. She just acted as if she was a bit dim because it is just so easy for Grant although we get to think it is a bit silly. Nigel Bruce just makes it even more funny but that is what we don't need. So its all okay and you know that Hitch is smiling up his sleeve as we think that it is all so clever as it is or not if we are still with the story.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Pat O'Brian is a priest trying to influence the angels with dirty faces. The lawyer Humphry Bogart is corrupt. The media manipulates the people with its headlines of violence. Violence becomes seductive in this 1938 film about manipulation. Telephones are used to make quick calls to influence events. Money can manipulate people.\nThe film is about the system becoming more corrupt than an individual. Corruption is contagious. The infantile thrill of a shootout outweighs the choir voices. Father Pat O'Brian has little appeal against the physicality and money of Cagney. He lies to the boys. The boys dress differently. They wear hats and jackets like Cagney. Cagney has a terrible end and the system that arrested him as a boy is to blame. O'Brian ran faster and escaped reform school.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

I never used to like him and then one day, something happened inside me, and things just clicked into place. I now think he is great value in anything I see with him. It's inexplainable but I now really like him. I find the same with Elisha Cook Junior. The fact that the Dead End kids were in this film would have normally turned me off watching it in the first place, and I don't care much for them in this film, but Cagney's presence somehow negates the irritation I feel whenever I see Leo Gorcey.\nAfter spending time in jail, gangster Cagney (Rocky) visits his lawyer friend Humprey Bogart (Frazier) to claim his $100,000.00 dollars but Bogart tells him that things are now different and so we now have 2 rivals and Bogey doesn't care for Cagney breathing air. These two connive against each other whilst Cagney expresses his softer side by looking after a bunch of kids - the Dead End kids - in his home town. Maybe they can learn to behave themselves under his guidance. His old friend Pat O'Brien (Jerry) is now the priest of the parish and also hopes that Cagney can turn away from his criminal activities to help the community and serve good for the troublesome teenagers.\nThe ending isn't very realistic, it's wishful thinking but I don't think the film should be knocked for veering off in this direction. The message is sound - change your ways if you can and youare on the slippery slope to ruin, and sacrifice your ego if you think your actions can benefit others.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0ac,tt0029870,Angels with Dirty Faces,lyubitelfilmov,20 April 2022,8,"Crime drama, noir. I wanted to look at this picture last year because of Humphrey Bogart (and another ""Treasures of the Sierra Madre"", but I'll tell you about it next time), but everything didn't work out, but now I found the time. And the result made me pretty happy, because the picture was worth watching and even made me think about some things. And here's my brief opinion for you - a philosophical parable of gangster America. There are no minuses in the picture, but there is some remark that I will write in a separate paragraph, and it's time to focus your attention on the expressive merits of this gangster drama.\nSo, here they are:\n1. Scenario - in the center of the story is the fate of two friends who, as children, were still mischievous and pranksters, but as a result of an unsuccessful robbery, one goes to prison, and the second manages to escape. The first, after many years of prisons and colonies, becomes a famous gangster and returns to his hometown and visits a friend who has become a priest during this time. And if everything was fine between them before, now they are on opposite sides of the barricades, and after all, the gangster does not intend to turn off the crooked road, and the priest wants to save the soul of a friend from eternal torment. That's right, we have an ordinary crime drama in the scenery of America in the thirties, where friendship is at the center of the story. The characters are bright and interesting, even secondary, everyone has a personality, and everyone can sympathize and find their weak spot. The picture is about the choice made by every person who has entered the criminal path and about the people who want to return it. The finale turned out to be very strong and emotional, even despite its brevity. And in general there are no unnecessary scenes here, everything is clear and to the point. If you miss interesting and well-developed crime dramas, and also noir, then do not miss this picture in any case!\n2. The atmosphere is gangster America of the thirties in all its glory: shootings, fights, everyday murders, gangsters in stylish business suits and with big money, corrupt officials and policemen, street kids admiring these same gangsters, intimidated townsfolk and a few brave souls who decide to challenge this whole corrupt system. There are a decent number of fights and shootouts in the picture, and they are made just fine for the late thirties. Everything is fast and brutal (although there is no blood). I love paintings and TV series that unfold in this historical period, and here the picture was shot in the late thirties, when memories are still alive and when this era began to fade into the past.\n3. Morality - what I like about crime films or TV series with the main characters of criminals is the obligatory morality that such a life will not lead to good. Yes, at first you will be happy with a lot of money and that power, but even if you are not killed by competitors, you will still end your life not in the best way, and this picture shows it perfectly. Although the first picture that clearly demonstrated this for me personally is ""Scarface"" with Al Pacino, but the roots come from the paintings of the twenties and thirties of the last century.\n4. Parable - it's not for nothing that I called the picture a philosophical parable in gangster America, because it is full of cruelty and gloom, and at the same time faith in a better future for young boys and girls who lived at that time, because they should not grow up in such a shameless, gloomy and corrupt environment, they should not admire criminals and murderers. And although life has shown that these dreams have not come true, but the very humanistic message and sincerity of this faith are captivating, although it will have to make great sacrifices to realize it.\n5. Acting - what can I say, the old school of acting, equally good both in capitalist America and in the communist USSR, when actors tried and did not spare themselves, they were selected suitable roles, and no one dared to fake. Of course, James Cagney, Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart attract the main attention to themselves, but other actors did their best, they looked convincing in the frame and you believe them, although they were all filmed in the pavilion.\nNow about the remark. There is one scenario blunder that was made for the sake of the development of the story, but logically it ruins the perception a little. This moment is only one, and it does not greatly affect the final grade.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Rocky Sullivan, played by James Kangi, is a famous gangster and childhood friend of priest Jerry Connolly, who after his release decided to return to his hometown and become his ""gray cardinal"". A bold, bold, cheeky and very ambitious gangster who is admired by many people and whom they want to emulate. No wonder James Kangi was nominated for an Oscar for this role - it's deserved! Bravo James!\n2. Jerry Connolly, played by Pat O'Brien, is a priest, a childhood friend of Rocky, who dreams of re-educating his friend and guiding him on the true path. Although he is a man of God, he can safely punch a scoundrel in the face. Pat demonstrated a slightly restless person who is torn between friendship and faith until he makes a final decision. Bravo Pat!\n3. James Fraser, played by Humphrey Bogart, is Rocky's lawyer, who ""heated up"" him and is now trying in every way to squeeze him out of his ""small"" business, although Rocky finds a loophole every time to stay at the top of power. It was unusual to see Humphrey in the role of a negative character, but even so he is remembered for his trademark cynicism and sarcastic smile, from which you can expect anything. Bravo Humphrey!\nIf you like noir - run to watch! If you like criminal pictures with interesting scenarios - run to watch! If you like perfectly written characters and interesting situations - run to watch! If you like to think about the questions that the pictures raise - run to look! If you like a great acting game - run to watch!\nAs a result, we have a good gangster drama with noir elements, an excellent philosophical script, bright characters and great acting!\nMy rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

This film is OK for its era, but otherwise I did not enjoy it.\nHere's my breakdown:\nSTORY:\nAn OK story of a gangster from his youth and a friend who chose priesthood instead of crime (as an adult).\nI found the relationship between them to be the only ""saving grace,"" but otherwise the story is flat.\nFrankly, there's so much violence and abuse that it becomes almost expected and ""normal."" Unfortunately,\nthis makes me sick and angry, as I see (again) how film can both portray and influence cultural values.\nFor all the advances in the sciences to present, we are still the same conniving, brutish creatures of yore.\nACTING:\nCagney was considered a ""good"" actor largely for his emotional intensity (I believe). But when you play the\nA-hole consistently I think it speaks to the actor's own persona, and partly why I've always disliked him.\nApparently, he disliked ""method acting,"" and this might also explain my disdain for his performances. He thought\nbeing himself was sufficient, but that, like so many things (we) men do - it's not skill, it's brute.\nAs a whole the acting was fine, but there are so many cliches and speed-talking that I can't give anyone kudos.\nSomething that confused me were the actors chosen to play ""Rocky"" as a boy and a member of the ""Dead End""\nkids. They looked so much alike that I was confused until the film ended and I could research (no, they're not the same actor).\nTEMPO:\nMoves along well\nCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nThe absolute joy of the film is to actually see NYC in 1938 in action!!! Wow, we're seeing the people, buildings, etc.\nDIRECTING / WRITING:\nThe director has a mammoth list of films to his credit (179), a number of which are quite good. I thought his ability to\nplace the camera at so many angles and heights in this film was superb. The writers however didn't seem to\nproduce anything memorable, and one eventually just went onto TV (blah).\nIs it a good film? If you like classics, then maybe.\nShould you watch this once?

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0b1,tt0044079,Strangers on a Train,timothywalton-31924,30 December 2023,6,"Strangers On A Train is a taut, thrilling murder film, but I find it inferior to most of Hitchcocks other works. The films flaw is in its premise itself- it seemed quite improbable that the police would believe a raving lunatic over a sane man, and that planting a lighter days after a murder can possibly be much admissible evidence to convict and try Haines. The film is also oddly structured, in that the plot moves rather slowly in the middle hour or so, and the true climax of the film, the really suspenseful, thrilling bits are the last 30 minutes of film. I find that Hitchcocks movies can be so,it into two kinds- action adventure espionage tales normally with a bit of wit and humour in them(North By Northwest, thirty nine steps, lady vanishes) or more serious thrillers with excellent dramatic acting(Notorious, Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo). Strangers On A Train falls squarely into the latter category, but its plot lacks enough tension, and its characters lack enough interpersonal relationships to truly ground and humanise the story. Notorious had a serious love story, Man Who Knew Too Much a family kidnapping story, and Vertigo and obsessive love story. Perhaps this film is most similar to Rope, but I find Rope to be more tautly constructed and more suspenseful. Of course, strangers on a train does have outstanding performances, notably the chilling, psychopathic portrayal of Bruno. It also has beautiful cinematography by Robert Burks. But ultimately, this story felt too cerebral, without a touching romance or drama to ground and humanise the story much.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0b2,tt0044079,Strangers on a Train,laurenspierre,13 December 2023,7,"I watched ""Strangers on a Train"" once before and remember, while certainly feeling entertained, not being particularly crazy about it back then. In revisiting the film as part of my Hitchcock marathon, expectations were high, considering its esteemed reputation for being one of the director's best works. Although my understanding of Hitchcock's cinematic language and appreciation of his visual inventiveness has grown since that first viewing, the overall impact of the film, unfortunately, still didn't resonate as strongly with me as it seems to do with almost everybody else.\nAs has been highlighted by many others, the movie boasts several brilliant set pieces that showcase Hitchcock's filmmaking brilliance. I think about the whole murder sequence, from the misdirection in the tunnel, using shadows and screams, to the actual deed being viewed through the lenses of the victim's broken glasses. Later, there's some intricate crosscutting between scenes of a tennis match and a character reaching for his lighter in the sewer, which elevates these ordinary activities to an almost unbearable level of suspense. The film's climax at the carnival is another testament to Hitch's ability to create high levels of tension from seemingly innocuous settings.\nIn ""Strangers on a Train"", rich-kid-with-daddy(-and-mommy)-issues (a Hitchcock trademark) Bruno Anthony approaches tennis pro Guy Haines with his theory for committing the ""perfect murder"" (another director trademark). One of the film's strengths lies in the performance of Robert Walker: he portrays Bruno Anthony as a charming, manipulative playboy who is gradually revealed to be a full-blown lunatic.\nHowever, in my opinion, the narrative falls short in fully exploring the potential of the intriguing premise (the ""murder swap""). Hitchcock's best works usually add some element of (moral or other) ambiguity, complex psychology or a plot twist that completely upends our perspective and the way we think of certain characters. ""Strangers on a Train"" doesn't have that additional layer of complication. The characters lack the depth and complexity that elevate Hitchcock's best works. Bruno Anthony is a psychopathic villain without any redeeming qualities (and a possible Oedipus complex). Guy Haines, in equally straightforward manner, is presented as an uncomplicated hero: he doesn't seriously consent with Bruno's plan for the murder swap, even though his wife is clearly shown to be a manipulative monster who cuckolds him. Guy is an upstanding citizen who just had the bad fortune of meeting the wrong stranger on the wrong train, his innocence never in doubt.\nIn the Hitchcock's pantheon, ""Strangers on a Train"" falls into the mid-tier for me. While I could better appreciate the technical finesse this time around, the film ultimately failed to really strike a chord with me beyond its visual bravura. The absence of extra intrigue, whether through engaging character development, interesting thematic elements, or unexpected plot twists, prevents it from being in the upper echelon of Hitchcock's work, occupied by classics like ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""Rebecca"", ""Notorious"", or the in many ways similar, but more richly layered, ""Rope"". Despite some captivating moments , ""Strangers on a Train"" remains a film where the technical brilliance outshines the narrative and thematic depth.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

All of the performances are right on and the story is interesting. I won't reiterate the story as that's already been covered here enough but I will say that the premise seems like the perfect crime, or pairs of crimes, in the making. So obvious and yet fresh sounding at the same time. But as we know in the movies, in real life, and especially with Hitchcock, things don't always go as expected. Good thing for the viewer because that's where the fun comes in for us. All in all Strangers on a Train is one worth checking out.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that beneath their surface façades lie layers of complexity and intrigue. The contrast between Guy's seemingly normal demeanor and Bruno's disturbing Oedipus complex and manipulation skills creates a tension that resonates throughout the film.\nBruno, a true fan of crime fiction, proposes a seemingly perfect murder plan: each man will commit a murder on behalf of the other, eliminating any motives and casting suspicion away. The film masterfully weaves a web of suspense and moral ambiguity as Guy, initially dismissive of Bruno's bizarre proposal, becomes ensnared in a spiral of crime orchestrated by Bruno himself. Despite the audience's inner urge to intervene and shout advice to Guy, the film captures his gradual entanglement with Bruno in a mesmerizing fashion. Guy's moral compromise and increasing vulnerability are portrayed with exceptional depth, creating a dynamic character arc that keeps viewers riveted.\nBruno's enigmatic and manipulative nature adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative. The psychological power play between him and Guy highlights the fine line between influence and control. The film delves into the question of whether individuals can be pushed to commit heinous acts against their better judgment. The exploration of Guy's transformation from a seemingly ordinary man to a participant in a sinister plot raises questions about the duality of human nature and the extent of moral compromise.\nAlfred Hitchcock's direction shines brilliantly in Strangers on a Train. The film's atmosphere is steeped in tension, psychological depth and morally complex characters. The juxtaposition of normalcy and darkness creates a haunting experience that lingers long after the film ends. The intricate narrative and character dynamics are elevated by Hitchcock's masterful storytelling techniques, resulting in a film that remains timeless in its allure.\nStrangers on a Train is not merely a film noir but a psychological exploration of crime, manipulation, and the intricate interplay of human emotions. With its suspenseful plot, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes, the film cements its place as a quintessential masterpiece in Hitchcock's illustrious career, inviting audiences to delve into the depths of human psychology and the allure of the unknown.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0ba,tt0044079,Strangers on a Train,fredrikgunerius,6 August 2023,10,"Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his career when he made this thriller - one of the most Hitchcockesque of all his movies. The idea upon which the crime plot, concocted by the brilliant Patricia Highsmith, is based is so simplistic and universal that it has an inherent elegance: Two men meet on a train and contemplate the idea of ""swapping murders"". That one of them may take it all a little more seriously than the other creates the basis for the playful perversities that ensue. As with almost all of Hitchcock's movies, the story invites several moral discussions and thematic ambivalences, which the director naturally exploits both narratively and visually. Hitchcock and his cinematographer Robert Burks, who worked together for the first time here, take full advantage of the array of possibilities black-and-white cinematography offers, not least by use of shadows and juxtapositions. These visual hints and suggestions aren't seminal, but they give the story a little extra zest. And they are part and parcel of how Hitchcock ambushes you in his subtle, sneaky way. You cannot help but be taken by Robert Walker's Bruno - even identify with him and his degenerate selfishness. Strangers on a Train is in many ways a much simpler film than other Hitchcock masterpieces such as Vertigo or North by Northwest, but it's a psychological portrait of timeless proportions. A tribute to human debasement, made possible by a wonderful performance from Robert Walker, who reached his zenith here before succumbing to his own demons later the same year.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Specifically, the ability for love at first sight.\nThe story is of a top notch insurance salesman who gets roped into a murder plot against the woman's husband.\nWalter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a slick guy but still can't resist the sultry nature of Phyillis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She is spunky and quick witted and reels in men due to her roller coaster behavior. Loving at first, but runs cold when she doesn't get what she wants.\nSo she uses the insurance savvy Walter to devise a plot to kill her husband, make it look like an accident and then collect on the insurance.\nWhat starts off as a plot to gain money becomes a more sexier topic. Do bad people fall in love? Yep.\nThe tables get turned in a film noir. Femme fatale spins a web for the poor dumb schlub to fall into. But in this case, something deeper goes on between them. She realizes he's a skilled manipulator. And the thought of doing away with someone as cold to a person so lacking of empathy spins the tables.\nThis is the fun that director Billy Wilder (my favorite director of all time) has with this flick. It becomes even better when Edward G. Robinson enters. He is Neff's direct manager and he has studied his insurance craft. He crunches numbers and lives at the office. He is also such a close friend to Neff that he never sees the evil within him.\nThe joy of Wilder is that he already tells you the outcome. And then we get the narration through a dictaphone which is the confession.\nIf you are planning to make a film noir...look no further for classic references than this one. It is incredible plotting.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Perhaps this was a factor that shaped my opinion about 'Double Indemnity', and I therefore should be mindful of that when judging this movie. I liked and enjoyed it, which my rating intends to convey. But there were a couple of aspects that slightly disappointed me as well.\nModern viewers probably need to recognise and keep in mind, a couple of important contextual points regarding this movie. Firstly, its subject material, plot and characters - particularly the portrayal of a woman of questionable virtue - had become rare for an A-level feature film in the United States, after the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934. Secondly, its commercial success proved that the movie-going public had an appetite for the genre, encouraging the industry to create the numerous imitators which soon followed.\nOne could draw a parallel that this movie did in 1944, what \nPulp Fiction (1994)\n did fifty years later. They both pushed the boundaries of what was palatable subject material, introducing new edgy dialogue and interactions between the characters, creating a new kind of ""Cool"" for their respective eras.\nI was disappointed with Fred MacMurray's lead performance, but it should be noted that my opinion here is definitely in the minority. I felt his efforts weren't very natural, especially in his scenes with Barbara Stanwyck, who came across as more comfortable in her role. Edward G. Robinson was unsurprisingly brilliant, and of these three mentioned stood out the most.\nMost people will enjoy this movie, and plenty will go much further with their praise. I personally rate it a fair way short of the greatest films noir, but of course, that is a very high bar indeed.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0c0,tt0036775,Double Indemnity,drewberiou,4 August 2023,10,"I wonder what did the writers in the 40s had that contemporary writers lack.\nThat's what runs in my mind every time I watch a classic.\nI'm not criticizing current writers (well who the hell am I to criticize anyone, anyway). It's just that notion you get when you watch something mind-blowing. How could something of more than 70 years old stay evergreen and amazing?\nAs for Billy Wilder's works, I first watched Witness for Prosecution and had the same astonishing elation witnessing the brilliance of its time. I thought that's the case with any film that has been adapted from novel, but make one wrong move while converting a novel to film language, and you could infect the essence of the story. And, Billy Wilder was one of the many masters of the craft in his time. Opening a movie by revealing what is it about and make the viewers think what more could I expect now that I know the act, and disappointing them for being a smartass is one of the many character traits of masters, in my opinion. That's the way I felt with Kurosawa's High and Low as well. Films like these are just making me fall in love more and more with classics.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0c4,tt0036775,Double Indemnity,Falkner1976,13 January 2023,10,"Based on ""the other"" novel by James M Cain, Double Indemnity is one of the quintessential classics of film noir, made precisely in the year of great classics of film noir: Laura, Woman in the window, Double indemnity, three great film noir as different as they are complementary.\nTo adapt and film this story, Wilder had the best of the best. As always, he signed a script in collaboration, but not with his usual partner Charles Brackett, but with Raymond Chandler; he had the highest paid actress and the highest paid actor of the moment, and with one of the greatest supporting actors (earning as much as the main ones). He had cinematography by John F. Setz (with whom he would collaborate on his best films for Paramount); and music by the highly renowned composer Miklós Rózsa (who would work for Hitchcock on Spellbound the following year).\nDouble Indemnity, of the three great classics of 1944 film noir, as is logical due to its origin, is the closest to the type of crime novel. It does not have the dreamlike and threatening atmosphere of Woman in the window, nor the elegant and obsessive emotional plot of Laura, but it is the one that most directly integrates the disenchanted world of corruption, which will be so characteristic of the genre, on a day-to-day basis of American society.\nDouble indemnity also shows the fascinating and sinister side of vulgarity, embodied in Barbara Stanwyck's shocking blonde wig (as opposed to Joan Bennet's glamorous femme fatale in Woman in the Window). It is that blonde wig, like the ankle bracelet, the great characterization trait of an attractive character in its striking vulgarity, above having to accommodate to established behaviors or aesthetics. Next to him, the stereotypical beauty of Jean Heather, whose paleness does not live up to the name of Lola Dietrichson, is completely nondescript.\nRegarding the novel, the film incorporates a curious flashback structure and an initial use of voiceover highly praised by the writer James M. Cain, which from the beginning introduces a character of tragic inexorability into the plot. Here the narrator is a dying man, a few years later Wilder will be even more ironic and extreme and he will be a corpse (Sunset boulevard). But more importantly, here our anchorage with the story, through whom we see it, with whom we identify is a criminal, and a criminal without palliatives and without extenuating conditions.\nThe story is a revision of The Postman always rings twice, but much seedier and dirtier. Here the murderers lack the romantic appeal of the film with Lana Turner and John Garfield (another great classic that would be made only 2 years later). We have Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, who one day meets Phyllis Dietrichson, the extravagantly beautiful and dissatisfied wife of a wealthy industrialist, in one of those mansions in a wealthy city of Los Angeles. There is an immediate recognition of each other's abilities, criminal abilities as well as amatory ones. Walter seems like he's been waiting his whole life to meet not only the girl, but also the opportunity to really put his theorical experience in crime and embezzlement to good use. The woman convinces Walter of her husband's cruelty, of the impossibility of living like this, but it is clear that she is convincing him because Fred wants to be convinced. Walter deep down cares little about murdering the husband, he wants the combination of girl and money that comes his way. Phyllis is presented with the chance to manipulate a man who doesn't even have to be manipulated into committing the murder she wants.\nHere, unlike The Postman Always Rings Twice, the love relationship between Walter and Phyllis repels and terrifies us, because both are nothing more than two cold and calculating murderers (who more, who less). But even so, we are on their side; inevitably suspense is built because we don't want them to be found out. Thus the tension of that wonderful scene of Edward G. Robinson (as the investigator for the insurance company, the only really positive role in the film) and Fred MacMurray talking in the corridor of his home, while Robinson waits for the elevator, and Barbara Stanwyck who has come to visit Fred believing him alone, hiding behind the wide open door (the door that opens in the opposite direction), is generated because we are obviously afraid that Robinson will discover the relationship between them.\nIt is a cinema from a time when, despite the Hays Code, ambiguity counted, where the viewer could face the ethical dilemma of identifying with definitely non-positive characters, and who have not been softened (no crimes of passion, or alienations momentary or permanent etc...), and reject them at the same time. All that was required is that each culprit at the end of the film receive their punishment.\nThe film features three unforgettable performances: MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Few actresses are as intelligent, honest and versatile as Barbara Stanwyck, here in one of her greatest roles. At all times she shows how the character dominates the situation, even sitting in the corner of a sofa where she does not occupy even half of it. The same can be said of Robinson, the quintessential gangster was at the same time one of the actors with the greatest ability to impregnate his characters with humanity, and conveys all the intelligence, enthusiasm, and ultimately the disappointment of the character. MacMurray, for his part, showed great courage in facing a role that required abandoning the ground he dominated, that of representing the honest and healthy average American. He was the perfect choice for the role and Wilder knew it.\nThe film is full of unforgettable scenes in addition to the one already mentioned: the first conversation between MacMurray and Standwyck, the meetings at the supermarket (plotting the murder between jars of baby food), the final duel...\nWilder would say that it was his best film, for a reason.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Despite my appreciation for this directorial aim, though, I found most of this slightly underwhelming in that department. Lots of quick cutting during regularly paced dialogue and no eagerness for blocking lengthier shots. Made me yearn for Welles in the director's seat, which is funny considering the film instantly gets better as soon as he shows up (his reveal is the best moment in it).

Has to be in any serious film buffs top 5.\nIt helps if you have read some Graham Green as it is a reflection on good and evil with two people who love someone who has turned out to be deeply flawed. But whom they still care for in their different ways. Deeply sad and gets me every time. And Ive watched it dozens of times.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

And that twist, oh my word! That immediately sparked excitement in me for the rest of the film. The writing is excellent of course, it's no wonder the likes of Martin Scorsese have waxed lyrical about it. This is my first time seeing an Orson Welles performance and he was subtly but strikingly captivating, and Ernst Deutsch deserves a shoutout as he was intriguingly most magnificent when he wasn't even saying a word. The small nuances in his facial expressions were remarkably perfect to show his true thoughts to the audience. To end on a small negative, I found the music choice very odd, as it didn't suit the tone of this tense, dramatic story one bit. As a result, the feature as a whole felt too unserious, despite the incredibly serious nature of the events unfolding.\nBut overall a fantastic noir which I'd recommend not only to fans of this genre, but also to those who love a good mystery.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Upon arrival he learns that his friend Harry Lime has died under bizarre circumstances. As Martins begins investigating his friend's death, he starts to hear conflicting stories on how his friend died and when he is lead to believe that a mysterious third man is involved he starts to suspect that Lime may have been murdered...\nI'm always up for watching an old classic film and spotting this film advertised on BBC2 this morning I decided to record it and watched it this evening. Here's my take on it...\nWith The Third Man what you essentially have is a fairly decent story that is relatively intriguing and yet for me there was still something missing here. It's one of those talky films which is fine if there is something else to back up all the chatter, but for me, the film lacked something in the way of pzazz and firepower. Even though the investigative side of the story is quite interesting the film is quite slow and I also found the score intrusive and over-used. Even from a technical perspective the film is on shaky ground; the editing and continuity for example are some of the worst that I've seen on cinema (though these things could be slightly forgivable given the age of the film).\nThe acting is acceptable but I didn't really feel that anyone truly shined here; again the presence of Orson Welles seems to increase the hype surrounding this film and whilst he is by no means bad here I fail to see why he is anymore worthy than many of the other good actors and actresses that populated this film.\nI liked some of director Carol Reed's touches in this film; his dark and dingy Vienna (with many scenes being filmed in London) does give the film a classic noir feel to it and some of the establishing shots showing large silhouettes was also a nice touch.\nFor fans of classic cinema The Third Man is definitely worth seeing as there isn't anything majorly wrong with it. However, for me to give a film a score of 7 or above it has to really involve me and have a true wow factor and/or something special about it. Sadly this film didn't quite manage to wring out that much emotion from me.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0cf,tt0033870,The Maltese Falcon,Prince-P,27 November 2023,7,"Dashiell Hammett was considered one of America's leading mystery writers. The New York Times even described him as ""the dean of the hard-boiled school of detective fiction"". But his stories have also had a significant impact on movies and TV shows, especially in the film noir genre. Hammett's most famous work was probably ""The Maltese Falcon"" from 1930. Here the public met the private detective Sam Spade for the first time. In him the world came across the archetype of the hard-drinking, hard-hitting, tough-talking gumshoe.\nIn 1941 an odd group of people started filming ""The Maltese Falcon"". John Huston had never directed before, Humphrey Bogart only used to play heavies in supporting roles and for 61-year-old Sidney Greenstreet it was the first time he appeared in a feature what-so-ever. But the executives at Warner Brothers weren't worried. The studio regarded the production as a typical B-movie. A cheap detective flick to run out in some of the country's small, insignificant theaters.\nDespite the fact that many of the people involved were so new to the game, the production flowed along at a rapid pace. This was largely due to the fact that Huston had scripted every scene and camera angle before photography began. The whole thing actually went so smoothly that the cast and their director could take long, leisurely lunches at a Country Club next to the Warner studio in Burbank.\nWhen ""The Maltese Falcon"" was released the response was so positive that the film instantly acquired A-status. It was quickly moved to bigger and better theaters. The movie also made Huston a respected director - and turned Humphrey Bogart into a star. The only one unhappy was Dashiell Hammett. The writer had sold the rights to his novel for $8,500 but now discovered that the character of Sam Spade had been part of the bargain. Dashiell Hammett never earned another penny from the film rights to his most famous creation.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Well, folks, let me introduce you to John Huston's 1941 film The Maltese Falcon-the third adaptation of the same-name novel in a decade, and hands down, the best one.\nIf you've always been skeptical of remakes, this film might make you reconsider. It's a cinematic gem that proves not all remakes are destined for mediocrity. Writing them off outright would mean missing out on this noir masterpiece.\nSet against the shadowy backdrop of film-noir, The Maltese Falcon is an early example of the genre's brilliance. Humphrey Bogart, known for his gangster roles, takes a departure and delivers a performance that's both gritty and nuanced. It's like seeing a familiar face in a new, captivating light.\nWhat struck me most is how the film unfolds its mystery. You don't even hear about the elusive falcon until well into the storyline. John Huston, who not only directed but co-wrote the script, pulls double duty with finesse. The result is a singular vision on screen that keeps you hooked from start to finish.\nThe Maltese Falcon isn't just a remake; it's a reinvention that stands tall among its predecessors. So, the next time someone bemoans the state of Hollywood's obsession with remakes, throw this film into the conversation. It's a compelling argument that some remakes aren't just necessary-they're downright exceptional.\nFORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\nVIDEO: 9/10.\nNative 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Good, Master condition: Excellent\nAUDIO: 9/10.\nDTS-HD MA 2.0 mono audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: N/A, LFE content: N/A\nMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0d1,tt0033870,The Maltese Falcon,alekspredator87,5 November 2023,7,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is a landmark 1941 film that still remains one of the best examples of the detective and noir genres. Director John Huston embodied on the screen a classic story about mystery, intrigue and romance, creating an atmosphere in which it is impossible not to get involved.\nOne of the main reasons why ""The Maltese Falcon"" has become a real cinematic gem is the unsurpassed cast. Humphrey Bogart as detective Sam Spade, along with Mary Astor as his mysterious client Bridget O'Shaughnessy, create amazing chemistry on the screen. The performance deserves the highest praise - their acting is full of energy, intrigue and unpredictability.\nThe script of ""The Falcon"" skillfully mixes elements of a classic detective film with comedy features and subtle hints of romance. The story of the search for a valuable falcon and the relationship between the characters seems simple, but it strikes with its unpredictability and the development of the plot. The dialogues are masterfully constructed and full of humor, which makes the film unique and memorable.\nThe visual style of the painting deserves a special mention. Houston creates an atmosphere of complete mystery, riddled with riddles. The black-and-white image enhances the effect of noir cinema, adding icy aesthetics and mystery to each scene. Lighting harmoniously combines with the characters and the environment, creating a game of shadows and shades, and the camera skillfully conveys the emotions and mood of the characters.\nThe musical accompaniment in the film sets the viewer to the right mood - jazz perfectly combines with the action on the screen, giving it dynamism and passion. The selected music creates the atmosphere of the era and subtly conveys the emotional state of the characters.\nOne of the main advantages of ""The Maltese Falcon"" is its time. The film skillfully works with the plot, characters and aesthetics of the 1940s, literally setting the genre outlines of that time. This desire for authenticity and aesthetics creates the impression of immersion in the past and allows the viewer to better enjoy every aspect of the painting.\n""The Maltese Falcon"" is certainly a memorable work that continues to be a milestone in cinema. An excellent combination of acting skills, an unforgettable script and visual style makes this film one of the most significant projects of its time.\n7 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Gutman very confidently plays a villain in control, which makes the story more compelling and exciting.\nGranted, the female supporting roles do seem a slight bit too dramatic and stiff in their performance at times. Sam Spade's secretary might be the most charming in this group.\nDirecting and cinematography is gorgeous, but the plot is, even though intriguing, lacking a bit in the end.\nOverall, it's not just Bogart that makes this film worth watching, but one could wonder how well it would've survived in people's minds over half a century if it would have had a different actor playing Sam Spade.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0d3,tt0033870,The Maltese Falcon,Jeremy_Urquhart,23 October 2023,7,"I've watched three John Huston movies lately, but none because they were John Huston movies necessarily. He's a director who made a range of films, and many of them are admirable... but I also find many of them kind of dry and boring in parts (Treasure of the Sierra Madre is maybe the only one I don't find slow in parts, for what that's worth).\nThe Maltese Falcon followed Casablanca at the double feature I saw tonight, and Casablanca is so much sharper from a writing perspective, and much better paced. The Maltese Falcon really drags in parts, and I felt restless watching it to some extent. It's all about various people wanting the titular object, and I don't know - it really drags things out to some extent, and while I don't think it's visually flawed, nothing about the way it looks was consistently super exciting to me.\nThat they got a feature-length film out of such a straightforward premise might be worth something, but the thing that does thankfully save The Maltese Falcon is the acting. Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre (both were also in Casablanca) are good, but it's Bogart (also of course in Casablanca) who's amazing here, and considerably elevates something I'd otherwise consider pretty dry. I think besides the acting, The Maltese Falcon is fair for its day, and overall not terrible, but just not one I really connect with all that much. I pretty much felt the same way back when I watched this during high school, while we were studying the film noir genre.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0d5,tt0033870,The Maltese Falcon,davidmvining,26 August 2023,8,"John Huston starts his directing career proper by creating a movie star in Humphrey Bogart. Bogart had been a supporting actor for WB for a few years (notably in things like Wyler's Dead End), but his turn as Sam Spade in the adaptation of the novel by Dashiell Hammett done by Huston himself put him on the cinematic map. And watching the film eight decades after its release (for the third or fourth time, to be honest), it's easy to see how he could capture the audience's attention in this sarcastic performance that glides through danger with ease. Throw in the mystery of a plot, and you've got a recipe for audience enjoyment.\nSam Spade (Bogart) runs a private detective business with his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) when a woman under a false name (Mary Astor) comes in and asks them to track the man who has her sister. It turns out that this woman, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, was lying about her reasons for following Floyd Thursby, and Sam finds out that night when both Miles and Thursby are murdered on the street half an hour apart. So begins Spade's search through a seedy underbelly of antique collection where no one says what they mean, and he has to sort through it all to find the truth, despite the unhelpful efforts of the police who want to lock him up for the murders. With the help of his secretary Iva (Gladys George), Sam stays one step ahead as best he can, especially when Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) sticks him up to find information about some mysterious black bird figurine, starting Sam on the path to find Mr. Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) who is also after it.\nThe joys of the film are in the combination of the tricksy nature of the plot and Spade's cool approach to unraveling what he got dropped in the middle of. I think part of the appeal is that Spade is simply not emotionally connected to anyone or the Maltese Falcon itself. We get a nice rundown of the history from Mr. Gutman, and Spade just listens blithely like he doesn't really care. He's constantly acting invested one moment, pretending rage or investment, but then going back to being smug and almost entertained by what he sees and hears. It's all ridiculous, and Bogart plays Sam like a detached member of the audience to a certain degree.\nThe film was obviously made on the cheap with almost half of the film and most of the final half hour taking place on a single set: Sam's apartment, but Huston makes the most of his camera, obviously having learned from Wyler on how to make his compositions interesting even in limited space. This especially becomes important in the final twenty-minutes or so where five people are in the living room of an apartment for almost the whole time, and Huston can pan his camera from left to right, getting all five into frame at different distances. It's not as complex or effortlessly accomplished as Wyler would have done it, but it is, nonetheless, well done.\nMy only real issue with the film is that despite all of Spade's apparent detachment from all of the events in the film, there's this last-minute need for him to be invested in Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. There are tears as he makes his terrible decision to invite justice upon her for her crimes, and I just don't think it follows from what we learned about from Sam Spade up to that point. There's a nice reveal about his motive for getting deep into it, regarding what one does when one loses a partner, but I never felt much that Spade was actually falling for the woman. He was toying with her as much as he had been toying with Cairo or Gutman or slapping around Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.), Gutman's right hand man, because he could and it entertained him while it got him closer to figuring out the answers at the center of the mystery.\nAnd that the mystery ends without a real conclusion, essentially Spade just closing one chapter in a larger adventure while talking about the Falcon being the stuff that dreams are made of is just kind of wonderful. That he's removed from the mystery because he doesn't actually care about the falcon provides this kind of distance to the manic behavior of the people he's dealing with that creates a better sense of fun in the tale.\nHuston entered the WB system as director in the early 40s, made a very fun and accomplished entry in their house style while applying the filmmaking lessons he'd learned from Wyler and keeping Hammett's storytelling intact. He bred a new movie star in the process and got his own directing career into a great opening state. The Maltese Falcon is a very good first film, and a fun movie in its own right.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

In my humble opinion, pacing in this film is far from perfect. It starts at a reasonable speed, we get to know the main characters, their intentions and the overall plot starts to unfold itself. But as we go deeper into the second act, the pace ramps up, to the point that keeping up with the story becomes a headache.

It's frenetic in pace, full of plot holes, a plot that's almost impossible to follow and makes little sense in the end.\nThe performances, especially Bogart's almost save it and are why I didn't give it a lower score, with the exception of Ms. Astor who I thought was terribly miscast in her role.

6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0d9,tt0048424,The Night of the Hunter,davidmvining,31 December 2023,8,"Charles Laughton's sole work as director is an accomplished, beautifully made, impeccably acted, and perhaps a bit too thin thriller, the announcement of a new talent behind the camera. And the reaction was muted contemporaneously. It was either the negative critical reaction or Laughton's simple preference for directing theater over film, but The Night of the Hunter marked the sole, enticing work behind the camera of Laughton who could have gone on to make several more films, giving us a legacy in film of him beyond his performances in films like Witness for the Prosecution. As it stands, though, if you are going to have only one movie to your name, you could do far, far worse than The Night of the Hunter.\nThe story follows the deranged preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who goes from town to town, killing women because he considers the frilly and lacey nature of modern women to be a blight upon God's creation. He's thrown in jail for stealing a car at the same time that Ben Harper (Peter Graves) is thrown in prison with a death sentence for killing two people while stealing $10,000 that he hid with his children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), without the knowledge of their mother Willa (Shelley Winters) because she's too trusting. Harry gets a hint of the money's location through Ben's sleep-talking, realizing that the children know. Harry becomes monomaniacal in the pursuit of the money, finding the newly widowed woman, playing up his charm, and marrying her in quick time, all while Pearl falls in love with him and John mistrusts him.\nThe meat of the film is all about danger, this deranged preacher man using his outward position as both a man of God and the new father to these children to commit and threaten violence in pursuit of the universal MacGuffin: a handful of cash. That sense of danger is palpable because of how in control Laughton was in terms of every aspect of the production. Firstly are the performances. The standout showstopper is Mitchum who balances between charming and viciously dangerous with ease. Considering the supposedly true stories of his deep drunkenness the deeper into production he got, that's kind of amazing and a testament to Mitchem as well as Laughton.\nThe supporting cast has their own great moments as well, the early parts dominated by Winters' combination of wounded, expectant, and pious that makes her sympathetic and pathetic all at once, the exact sort of woman who would fall for a slick operator like Powell. That latter half is dominated by the silent film star Lillian Gish who appears as a kindly old woman who takes in wayward children cast out during the Depression, who adds John and Pearl to her brood after the two escape from Powell's murderous ways.\nWhere the film works surprisingly well (only because Laughton was an actor, really) is how gorgeous the film looks from beginning to end. It's rarely realistic, those moments relegated to scenes outside during the day, and there's a heavy use of shadow from the DP Stanley Cortez that takes a full step into German Expressionism, especially the moment that Powell reveals his true nature to Willa, complete with exaggerated arm movements. The action moves outside after Powell becomes too big of a threat, and the river gets filmed on a sound stage primarily at night, creating that artistic look of night where every major figure in the distance is backlit by some major source of light, causing outlines in the dark rather than needing to rely on heavily filtered brightly lit scenes.\nI suppose one reason I'm held back in appreciation slightly is that good wins. It doesn't feel right for the story, especially after Powell escapes from a lynch mob and disappears from the story completely. There's a happy note at the end, unalloyed by any other emotion, and it doesn't quite seem to fit the rest of the film. The book ends definitively with Powell dying at the hands of the lynch mob, but the movie has him get away, and then we have a happy ending. It just doesn't quite fit. Plus, there doesn't seem to be much of a point by the end except the thrills of the chase we've had, and when we have this happy ending, it seems incongruous with what came before.\nStill, that's a minor concern. It's a beautifully shot, well-acted, and thrilling ride through the American midwestern countryside. That it was poorly received at the time is not the biggest of surprises. It's all about children in danger and is overwhelmingly meanspirited for much of its runtime, but it's also such a good thrill ride as it goes.\nI do wish Laughton had directed more. He showed real promise.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

As concerned with power, manipulation and control - especially but not exclusively of the religious variety - as it is with the maguffin of the money, it sings with technical excellence, vivid symbolism, and haunting imagery. Mitchum is terrific, but it's the children who really shine; the cinematography draws many memorable and unsettling images, and the pastoral setting is used to evoke some disturbing, worrying parallels. Timeless and masterful, it's hard to forget. What the director might have gone one to accomplish is one of cinema's great unanswered questions.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0dd,tt0048424,The Night of the Hunter,tonypeacock-1,7 December 2023,8,"The plot is very simple but effective. A con-man, posing as a preacher tries to get his hands on $10000 stolen from a bank and hidden by the perpetrator in his daughter's doll, something the Preacher at first doesn't know about.\nThe cast performance most notably by Robert Mitchum as the deranged preacher is a highlight of the film. One minute he is menacing in his quest for the money ($10000 was a hell of a lot of money in Depression era America when this film is set) and the next quite comical as a supposed Preacher talking to God and preaching to townsfolk.\nThe photograpjhy is a highlight of the film and deserves some mention. It has some German expressionism tones that reminded me of 1920's silent cinema with its shadows, shapes and style.\nFirst time director Charles Laughton was ahead of his time using techniques from behind the times somewhat! So it was with some tragedy that this was his first and only film as director after this film had a disappointing financial and critical reveption on release back in 1955 and has only gained a healthy respect including IMDB score today. He could and should have furthered his career as director.\nInfluences on modern cinema works I can recollect are notable including the Coen brothers in several of their films including their version of True Grit (2010) and in particular I thought of No Country For Old Men (2007) where a similar odd character chases the money (Javier Bardem).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0de,tt0048424,The Night of the Hunter,jamesrupert2014,4 December 2023,9,"The 'Reverend' Harry Powell (Robert Mitcham), a serial killer posing as a 'fire'n'brimstone' preacher, tries to con, then force, the children of Ben Harper (Peter Graves), his recently executed cell-mate into revealing where the cash from a bank heist is hidden. Charles Laughton's only directorial effort is full of offbeat characters, unsettling music, near-surreal cubist imagery, and poetically expressionistic scenes (notably Willa Harper's (an unusually restrained Shelly Winters) final scene in the river). Mitcham is quite good as the creepy black-clad 'hunter', a bit stagy and over-the-top at times, but that is not unexpected for a character playing a character. The actors playing John and Pearl, the Harper young'uns (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are also quite good as are veterans Lillian Gish, the elderly lady who takes the children under her wing and promptly sees through Powell's phoney preacher shtick, and Evelyn Varden, the elderly self-righteous busybody who doesn't. Much of the film was shot on soundstages and Laughton plays with the artificiality of the sets and the lighting to give his film dream-like vibe (the intent to look a bit 'unreal' could explain some of the minors 'errors' noted in the IMDB goofs section). The Night of the Hunter was a unique fusion (for the 1950s) of aesthetics and genres that was a failure with contemporaneous audiences and critics but has since been recognised as a well-crafted piece of 'art-noir'.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Powell decides to find the money by marring Harper's widow and convincing Harper's children, John and Polly, to reveal the location of the money. Unfortunately for Powell, John is made of stronger stuff than he would think.\nAfter having disposed of this wife in the usual way (shown graphically, but not horrifically) Powell scares the children into escape and there starts the most intriguing part of the movie, with an expressionist journey on the river until John and Polly find salvation with a strong woman, played by silent movies star Lillian Gish.\nMost movies narrated even partially from the POV of children tend to be boring and dissatisfactory, but this one works, both because of the strong expressionist style and thanks to the performance of Billy Chapin, a child actor who would have probably deserved a more successful career.\nDespite the dark themes and eruption of violence, the film remains an almost magic, abstract experience with a glimpse of hope.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dea783f0cdafc9b0e1,tt0048424,The Night of the Hunter,fugazzi49,8 October 2023,10,"""The Night of the Hunter"" is as good as all the praise heaped upon it would indicate, if not even better. It is a magnificent film. It took a long time to achieve its reputation. I remember upon first seeing it, that I assumed it was considered a great classic, only to be shocked later on at discovering it was a failure in its day, both financially and even critically. The truly bad thing is that Laughton did not live to see his intensely dark vision appreciated for the masterpiece it was.\nIt's not entirely surprising in the easy view of hindsight to see that the film was completely out of step with the trends of its time, an idiosyncratic work by Laughton unlike anything else around. This is true both stylistically and in its deeply disturbing undercurrents. Laughton wanted to bring much of the visual sense of silent film to his movie and not only insisted that it be shot in black and white, but freely borrowed German Expressionist techniques that lent a distorted, surrealistic, dreamlike look and feel to the film. This, at a time when film was increasingly leaning toward realism and location shooting, was guaranteed to perplex the average audience.\nLaughton's technique was a kind of stylistic artfulness that showed itself to the viewer - one can see the exaggerated shadows, the at times highly stylized sets and the unusual camera angles - and appreciate what these add to the film. Every moment has been considered. But this clashed with the current, more naturalistic style which tried to portray life on film as if you were simply seeing it somehow, as if there was no camera. This effect was amplified by location shooting in color - you weren't supposed to see the hand of the director. But it's there in all its glory. And it becomes ever more unreal and dreamlike on the perilous river journey taken by the children on swirling moonlit currents accompanied by an eerie, melancholy, folk-like children's song, with stylized houses and barns looming large, the way children would see them. It's unforgettable.\nThe film was also too dark and terrifying for its time. Essentially a noirish horror film, its scenario of a murderous killer pursuing two small children was really too much for the culture of 1955 America; this was five years before ""Psycho"" would blow up all previous conventions of film horror. In 1955, so-called scary movies were about giant squids or ants on the loose or an invasion from outer space. This was much too real and closer to home. The victims here were decent people, not the urban people who lived in the shadows in crime films. And the ones in most peril of their lives were a young boy of eleven and his even younger sister. It was too scary to contemplate.\nThe film grabs you right away with its opening scene of children playing hide and seek discovering a woman's dead body and doesn't let go. It briskly moves ahead from development to development without illustrating all that would have gone on between, assuming you've seen enough movies to not need that. It leaves no breathing room. Robert Mitchum's first appearance as self-appointed Preacher Harry Powell is almost immediate and he's so mesmerizing as he talks to God that we don't mind the fact that the scenery going by is obviously a rear-screen projection.\nMitchum is an absolute terror in this film. He had the physical presence and a powerful, stentorian voice and could project a sense of menace with little effort. (Much of this, I believe, came from his wild, wandering youth, expelled from school, riding the rails, roustabouting from job to job - much like Steve McQueen - but more intimidating). He becomes more and more of a monster as the film progresses, at one point seeming like the Frankenstein monster as he pursues the children with his arms momentarily stretched out before him. He tears through underbrush like an animal, and in the course of the film howl's three primal screams: at the cellar door, on the bank of the river and at Miss Cooper's farm.\nThe Reverend Powell also has a sexual magnetism that enables him to attract women and enrapture audiences in his sermons on good and evil, words which he famously has tattooed, one on each hand. He fools the people of the small West Virginia town. They never suspect that he has come there with a plan: to find the $10,000 he knows cellmate Ben Harper must have hidden there (worth about $200,000 today). He'll go there, marry the widow and then kill her and run - to him, all doing the Lord's work. He's a truly twisted man.\nThis is in the midst of the Great Depression, a time when even children are on the roads. In a touching scene a farm woman hands out potatoes to children who come to her back door then shushes them away brusquely, lest she begin to feel too much. That's why John and Pearl Harper's father stole the money, so that wouldn't happen to his children, and that's why he made John swear he would never, never tell where it was hidden. John is the only one not fooled for an instant by ""Reverend"" Harry Powell, though he's so lacking in guile that he doesn't even pretend to like Powell and is incautious enough to give away the fact that he knows something.\nIt's all dark for him, too, from the very beginning when he sees his father being brutally arrested by the police and when the other children taunt him about it. There is one bright spot for him, so bright it almost grabs you out of the dark reality of the film. A paddle-wheeling riverboat comes down the Ohio River, past John and his only friend, Uncle Birdie, a local old man, probably considered eccentric, who lives on a small boat tied up on the river's bank. Suddenly it's outdoors in sunlight in a scene right out of Mark Twain, everybody waving and Americana music in the background. This is John's one place of refuge, but it's not truly safe. At the worst moment he is alone there with those around him practically catatonic, but he rises to that moment and takes charge.\nThe music was important in that scene as it is throughout the film. William Schuman's soundtrack grabs you with rough, harsh monosyllables reminiscent of old horror films that underscore what this film really is. (Laughton owes much to the old Universal horror films as he does to the silent films he studied before making ""Night of the Hunter"", not surprising considering his first American film was James Whale's ""The Old Dark House"". It even has a scene of a mob of locals with torches). But the score also contains the melancholy river melody, a poignant lullaby and this bit of Americana.\nEveryone in the film plays their role perfectly, even secondary characters like Icey Spoon, the local town busybody (Evelyn Varden) and her henpecked husband Walt (Don Beddoe) and of course James Gleason as Uncle Birdie. Shelley Winters seems totally like a country woman from the Ohio Valley. You'd never guess she had been typecast as a blonde bombshell when she stands looking at herself in a full length mirror on her wedding night. A number of big name actresses had wanted the role (including Grace Kelly and Betty Grable) but Laughton didn't want a movie star and knew Winters had serious aspirations since she had attended his Shakespeare classes early in her career. Besides, a big star would require more screen time and that would throw off the careful balance of the film.\nFinally, there's Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper, a kind woman who takes in wandering children at her farm and helps them. She's the absolute opposite of Harry Powell and is not just sweetness and light but hard and tough as nails when she needs to be. She's also a literal connection to the earliest silent feature films which Laughton had studied. Like Mitchum's personification of evil, she also has a role which at times becomes archetypal. Her farm is like an Eden in a world of destitution. She also introduces the film reading Bible stories to children. The Bible plays a part in this story as well, introducing the wolf in sheep's clothing and Moses being rescued from the reeds of the River Nile, both of which foreshadow the film to come. You'll rarely find a film as powerful and cinematically beautiful as ""The Night of the Hunter"".",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Of course, it helps a lot that the story is based upon the work of acclaimed novelist, Daphne Du Maurier. Even the best directors need desperately a good story in order for their movie to be great, they are not magicians to pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even Hitchcock himself has created some not so memorable movies because script didn't help him.\nIt's not just Du Maurier. Acting is always one of the best qualities in Hitchcock movies but acting here is even better than the average of them. Laurence Olivier's acting is transcendental, dare i say, mythical. Fontaine is also excellent, and truth be told, her role is even more demanding, not so ""glamorous"", more introvert and subtle : These roles are always harder than a loud character who screams and yells, displaying his rough emotions.\nIn conclusion, this is a great drama/mystery movie, a bit less suspensful than his other best movies, but amongst his most well-written movies with really unexpected twists and turns. Last 40 minutes are amazing. I didn't love this movie until then, and that's the reason i didn't rate it higher.

Sometimes his style is elusive in a particular scene, more often it excites when the viewer sees that memorable suspense and tension. ""Rebecca"" is a project a little unusual for the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Although all the recognizable aspects of the director are present here, the detective and the love line come to the fore. And this is undoubtedly a successful approach to the presentation of this particular work.\nI remember the picture and the variety of beautiful plans. The team of creators did a great job on the scenery, presenting the rather detailed rooms of the mansion to the audience.\nBut the main characters in the film, of course, are the characters played by Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. Moreover, in my opinion, Olivier acts as a ""second fiddle"". The main decoration of the painting is Fontaine, her game pleases and fascinates. The heroine looks both strong and lost, puzzled, and sometimes afraid of what is happening. The whole range of acting skills of the actress allows you to feel how complex her heroine is. I am sure that other contenders for this role, among whom, by the way, were the stars of the recent ""Gone with the Wind"" Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, would hardly be able to convey the image of the heroine, which was so successfully embodied by Fontaine.\nOlivier is also good. The Englishman very subtly conveyed the aristocratic image of his hero, who has all the recognizable features of such persons. His hero is confident, determined, and of course it is his story that becomes something to be explored by both the heroine of the film and the audience.\nThe acting work of all the other participants in this project is also good. I wouldn't single out anyone in particular, everyone coped perfectly. Hitchcock, as a masterful director, perfectly staged the picture, playing on the feelings of the audience and skillfully presenting this or that scene exactly as he knows how. The picture became the best at the Oscar ceremony in the corresponding year, taking the coveted statuette. The second award, which the creators could boast of, was the best work of the operator.\n""Rebecca"" is a worthy film of its time. Often the picture is forgotten because of the more famous works of the master of suspense, including the legendary ""Psycho"", ""Birds"", ""Window to the courtyard"" or ""In case of murder, dial ""M"". However, this is a high-quality project that will still be interesting today with its unforgettable atmosphere of detective and drama.\nThe authors elegantly conveyed a mysterious story that is literally imbued with the intangible, but very distinct and even dangerous presence of the one called Rebecca.\n7 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

The beginning seems an excellent romantic comedy, what is not usual in Hitchcock's filmography (although it may also be seen in great Lady Vanishes). Gorgeous Joan Fontaine is extremely charming in the role of the clumsy and insecure woman whose name is never mentioned, and she has a good chemistry with Lawrence Olivier as the leading couple. The story has well developed and interesting characters, such as her Mrs. De Winter, his Maxim, and others among whom I may highlight flamboyant Mrs. Van Hopper and creepy Mrs. Danvers. However, an unique element is the strong presence of another character who is indeed absent: the Rebecca from the title, previous Mrs. De Winter. Probably, this is the most striking presence of a character who is only mentioned in the whole history of cinema. After the aforementioned romantic comedy beginning set in Monte Carlo, the movie continues engaging but with a dramatic genre twist, moving to a strong drama and psychological thriller, set in the gargantuan mansion Manderley, in Cornwall.

However, while the film is certainly entertaining, it falls far short of the masterful pieces of Hitchcock's later career and is, in fact, overrated.\nOne of the primary issues with ""Rebecca"" is the implausibility of its story setup. It is hard to believe that a stunningly attractive girl like Rebecca would marry someone for their wealth without any emotional interest whatsoever, especially when she could marry anyone who had both wealth and whom she might love. Furthermore, it seems improbable that Maxim de Winter would not have the faintest clue that Rebecca was a cruel, evil monster before marrying her. Additionally, it is difficult to believe that de Winter would leave the management of his entire estate to someone as stereotypically cruel and obviously insane as Mrs. Danvers.\nWhile some other aspects of the story are explained in the film, such as why de Winter did not simply get divorced to save himself from suffering, these explanations still feel barely believable. The acting does not help matters, as never for a moment does one feel that de Winter is genuinely in love with his second wife - who in turn comes across as extremely naive and silly, even if her daunted timidity is well portrayed. Meanwhile, Mrs. Danvers is portrayed more as a fairytale witch than a real person. The list goes on.\nMoreover, the police investigation and the ad-hoc incrimination by Mr. Favell have nothing to do with any sort of reality. You might argue this is consistent with the overall mystic-nightmarish ambience of the movie. But as a psychothriller, it is psychologically way out of line. Perhaps it might have worked better as a gothic tale or horror film.\nFinally, the film is permanently drenched in a cheesy sauce of music, which becomes annoying after a while.\nWhile ""Rebecca"" is undoubtedly worth watching as a classic of the genre, it is not a must-see film in Hitchcock's oeuvre.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Heck, who am I supposed to be rooting for here, the ex-lover who would do anything for her while he associates with evil doing German scientists that treat her with respect and dignity (well, until the end of the film) or the hero federal agent she's in love with that keeps reminding her how ""fast"" she works when he gets upset with her.\nAfter thinking back about it this way, it's no wonder she's got a drinking problem; who wouldn't?\nAnyhow, despite even her romantic love (Cary Grant) making disparaging remarks to her, somehow I still believed that these characters care deeply about each other (I credit the acting of Ingrid Bergman over the writing and Cary's mostly mannequin performance here).\nAs far as the story goes, it's pretty standard straightforward stuff really, and it almost feels like this film could have been created by any director.\nHonestly, if someone showed me a large chunk of this film for the first time without those handful of distinct Hitchcock camera work scenes and asked me who directed it I don't think I would know (even after revisiting a lot of his catalog recently). But, I'm no movie history guru, so maybe this film has been used as a template for other movies so much that it's formula seems tired to me.\nOutside of the repeated ""easy"" commentary and drunk driving scene, the rest of this movie is fine. You could say that the wine cellar key part was a bit clumsy in the end, but there's not a lot that I would call bad here either.\nIt's an ok movie, but I'd recommend watching a better Cary Grant/Hitchcock film like 'North by Northwest' or 'Suspicion' over this.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b0f1,tt0038787,Notorious,Falkner1976,4 July 2023,10,"One of Hitchcock's great masterpieces, and the best of his films with Ingrid Bergman. A disturbing love story perfectly framed in a story of suspense and espionage.\nThe entire beginning of the film may seem somewhat rushed, until the arrival in Rio, and of course it is difficult for us to understand today so much concern for the joyful life of the protagonist, for the fact of seeing her hanging out and getting drunk with her friends. We have to put on the glasses of the 40s.\nWe have Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi emigrated to the US and convicted of treason. His daughter, from the moment she discovered what her father was and rejecting him, has dedicated herself to a ""dissolute life"", she is a woman doubly marked, as the daughter of a traitor to the country and as an alcoholic and apparently a woman of many many men.\nThis first scene where Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant appear is magnificent, although we don't find Ingrid's drunkenness entirely credible (one of those perfectly aesthetic drunkennesses where the actress is not allowed to lose an iota of her beauty). Cary Grant is a dark and impassive presence, as he will be throughout the film, watching the girl from a distance. He can be certainly disturbing when he gives her a punch. When Cary Grant offers her to work as a spy for American intelligence, Ingrid Bergman's reaction can be hard to understand: the initial blunt refusal changes in a second when the rich old man comes to pick her up for a luxurious boat trip. Naturally, Ingrid, at that moment, has clearly seen the two options in her life: and being the toy of an elite of rich and libidinous elite does not seem to be the best of the two.\nSo, turned she into a spy, they travel to Rio, awaiting information about their mission. And for eight days, Bergman falls in love with Cary Grant, and a third option seems to emerge in her life, but this option, of course, also depends on Cary Grant.\nAnd Cary Grant doesn't seem to be up for the task: distant and somewhat contemptuous of the ""stained"" past of the protagonist, he feels attracted to her, probably falling in love too, but clearly on the defensive: after all, a girl with a past who is the daughter of a traitor is not just a good game. It may be the very least to demand proof that she has changed, a heroic rejection of her past and everything like it. It may almost be better not to get those proofs, and have an excuse not to fall in love. We begin to think that for Grant Ingrid Bergman is a dangerous threat.\nHitchcock never shows it more clearly than in the wonderful kissing scene on the hotel terrace. Bergman was never more passionate, sensual and seductive, without getting Grant to abandon a recalcitrant and detached attitude. The camera follows them in a closeness of the most absolute indiscretion, it is almost becoming somewhat embarrassing (and delighting) for us to attend such intimacy. Anyway the call from Grant's boss to meet him in his office and explain what Ingrid's job will consist of seems almost a relief for him.\nThe job turns out to be a mission a la Mata-Hari, and also with a possible old boyfriend of Ingrid's. Enough, Grant thinks, for a converted and sanctified Ingrid to have to unceremoniously reject the job and provide him with the proof he needed. But Ingrid can't take that initiative... without that third option in her life she was talking about showing itself minimally viable, because without Grant and without working as a spy, she's left with drunken binges with the rich. And of course...that third option was up to Grant...who takes a more inscrutable stance than ever. Grant shows his love and respect for her when he talks to his bosses aside, while for her he only has cold and hurtful phrases. It almost seems that Grant is hoping that Ingrid will accept the job of seducing another man, and that way, being able to despise her, she will become a harmless woman.\nThe moments of greatest tension take place at the party of the new and unlikely Sebastian marriage. There are shots as surprising as the beginning of the scene in which the camera initially shows the guests enjoying themselves elegantly at the party, but which becomes more tense as it approaches the object of our concerns: a key hidden in Bergman's hand.\nIt is especially from here that Grant's character becomes more and more unjustifiable, not hesitating in the slightest to put the woman he is in love with in serious trouble in order to get information from the investigation they are carrying out. It would be unbelievable that after the scene at the cellar Bergman would not be discovered, but even so Grant abandons her to her fate without regard. Does it seem so unlikely to him that they will take drastic measures against her? Does it matter so little? At this point it may seem to us that Grant's bitterness and unwarranted rancor has turned into cruelty and sadism.\nBoth Grant and Bergman are terrific. Among the supporting cast, Claude Rains gives enormous relief and sympathy to the character of the villain and especially jealous husband, but the one that is truly unforgettable is Leopoldine Konstantine as his jealous and dangerous mother. When Ingrid is welcomed into her home for the first time, we see her mother descend the stairs from a distance, with a face that we barely make out, but in which we guess a deeply sinister character. As she gets closer, the distrust and resentment she harbors towards the woman with whom his son is in love becomes more and more evident, until for a moment she enters the shadows, and although we are almost sure that she has not changed the expression on her face, when she comes to light again, appears to us as a polite old woman anxious to be pleasant to what may be her future daughter-in-law (in a certain way it is conceptually an inverse shot of the famous tracking shot of the party that is increasingly tense as it approaches the foreground of the key).\nThe romantic music is by Roy Webb, although for the soundtrack of the more suspenseful scene, Hitchcock opts for the Brazilian music that the band plays at the party. Bergman is especially beautiful in this film especially when her hair is let down, and of course her wardrove is by Edith Head.\nThe script, signed by Ben Hecht but in which, as always, Hitchcock was the determining factor, manages to give coherence to all this hodgepodge of emotions and builds around them a story of suspense and mystery using a series of recurring visual elements: bottles of wine, keys, cups of tea, and of course a majestic staircase. But as always with Hitchcock, it's his purely visual storytelling that makes the difference. Many scenes are true masterclasses in cinematic storytelling, the more interesting the less dialogue they have.\nIn short, a masterpiece by the author, among his five or six best films.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

I wanted to see the sneaking element of it and how they achieved what they set out to do, how they discovered their information, but it was more about Devlin's (Cary Grant) jealousy towards Alicia (Ingrid Bergman) instead, added to a lack of trust which caused even more problems.\nIt didn't have to be like 'James Bond' with gadgets and fast cars, but it just needed that something else to be interesting about it, because the romance was of such a basic formula that it could have been written by anyone and wasn't enough on its own.\nThe leading pair fell in love so quickly, as they tended to do in films of that era, but they were also far too over the top with it and so fakely passionate that it was hard to watch at times. I felt like a cringing teenager watching his Dad kissing his Mum and groaning about it, but it was a lot and very theatrical.\nClaude Rains, who played the role of Alex, has been really growing on me though. Having seen him in quite a few films lately, it has been easy to see why he got so much work in his time. I really appreciate his clear diction apart from anything else.\nCary was his usual self and I suppose that Ingrid Bergman was good too, but nobody really delivered anything outstanding by my standards.\nOverall, it wasn't the best Hitchcock, the best spy film or film in general for me personally, but it wasn't so bad that I wanted to turn it off. I can't say that I'd watch it again though.\n379.99/1000.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

The scheme works well until Rains proposes to Bergman, which initiates a cascade of suspicion, masquerade, jealousy and repressed emotions. Hitchcock mixes sentimental romance with fairly reverberant political spy drama in the wake of WWII - a Casablanca with Hitchcock's stamp of paranoia and angst, if you like. The film's power lies in the obscure and implicit. Nobody ever says or does what they really want; they are inhibited by their own reserve and the implications of a world war. When Bergman realizes the danger she's in towards the end, Hitchcock flaunts his visual skills to tighten the grip on her and us. The film's final fifteen minutes are so tense that you may forgive whatever sullen melodrama you've been subjected to along the way. Claude Rains' Oscar nominated performance is a lot more layered than what you might think at first.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b0f5,tt0038787,Notorious,HotToastyRag,27 February 2023,5,"The famous part about Notorious was the kiss scene. Back in the day of the Production Code, it was against the rules to have a kiss last longer than three seconds, so in order to get around that, Alfred Hitchcock told his actors Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman to keep interspersing bits of dialogue in the breaks of their kisses. They talk, they kiss, they talk again, they kiss again. However, if you're a connoisseur of old movies, you know that several movies broke the three-second-rule before Notorious did. Much like Gone With the Wind's hype, it was just publicity rather than fact. If you want to see a movie that really broke the kiss code, rent Fallen Angel and ask, ""Cary who?""\nIf anyone cares about the plot, it would be best to read about it beforehand. As usual, this Hitchcock drama is very slow-going and quite boring; I had to watch it twice to stay awake long enough to actually understand the story. In any case, Ingrid Bergman gets asked to be a spy by secret agent Cary Grant. Her father was an evil Nazi, and her assignment is to pretend she's following in his footsteps with his old cronies - then report all her findings back to Cary and the government. Claude Rains is the head bad guy, in a different role from Casablanca, but believable as a wealthy, slimy, power-hungry villain nonetheless.\nNotorious isn't my favorite Hitchcock, so I wouldn't really recommend it unless you love his slow style. You can catch Ingrid and Cary again in Indiscreet, a delightful romantic comedy and reportedly one of their favorites!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

With so many enemies, nobody would leave his wife alone in an abandoned hotel in a foreign country. In their honeymoon. If something like that had happened in a movie nowadays, noone would have bought it and everyone would find it ridiculous.\nIn any case, actors are great, it's well directed and for sure, this is timeless. A classy movie that every cinema fan should watch it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b102,tt0052311,Touch of Evil,filipemanuelneto,5 September 2023,8,"One crime and two totally different men: this sentence almost sums up the entire film. Director Orson Welles is one of those monsters that we are used to having like a ""sacred cow"", who turns everything he touches into gold. And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very recently that it was possible to have access to a version of this film that was similar to what its director's creative vision was. . Just similar!\nAnd what we have here is an incredibly complex film that we cannot summarize as easily as I did: the initial crime is just the incident that triggers the action, and its relevance, we found, is really insignificant. What counts here is the struggle of personalities, the battle between the conflicting egos of two police officers who decide to solve the case, each in their own way. In fact, it is not the most appealing film that the director's career has given us, but it is still valuable for that reason. And to understand Welles' vision, it's not enough to see the film once. We have to understand nuances that go unnoticed by an inattentive eye. It's an exercise for cinema experts, more than for me, who am part of the common popcorn-eating public, but even I saw that the work before me deserved to be seen in detail.\nThe film that has come down to us allows us to see the brilliance of Welles, who was also responsible for the dialogues and the script created, full of twists and turns that can complicate things a little for us if we are not paying attention, and, but it also gives us good actors in a decent dramatic exercise. Charlton Heston is a safe bet, but it's also a big casting mistake: he's too Anglo-Saxon to be credible as a Latino! Welles brought the other main character to life, and is effective and dominant in the role. To a certain extent, he never seems like a police officer, but just another criminal in a land where those in charge are those who impose themselves through violence. Even so, I noticed that he is a physically worn-out man, and this fragility ruins the effect he intends to achieve.\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the cinematography, which in Welles' films is almost always one of the director's signatures. In addition to the use of intelligent visual effects, the director dedicated himself to the camera work and the choice of each perspective, each framing, and also in the editing, which was ruined by the studio's intervention. The filming locations and sets are realistic and convince us quite well, and the soundtrack is effective.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b103,tt0052311,Touch of Evil,beachtv-1,21 May 2023,10,"Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" is a quintessential film noir, an audacious fusion of style and substance that underscores the director's mastery over the medium. Released in 1958, it's a compelling exploration of the blurry lines between good and evil, carried by an all-star cast and an abundance of stylistic flair.\nThe plot revolves around a border-town murder mystery, with Charlton Heston portraying the honest Mexican narcotics officer, Mike Vargas, and Welles himself as the corrupt American police captain, Hank Quinlan. The stark contrast between these two characters lays the foundation for a captivating narrative that traverses a morally ambiguous landscape.\nHeston and Welles deliver powerful performances, each embodying their character's attributes with convincing authenticity. Janet Leigh, as Vargas' newlywed wife, is also noteworthy, adding a touch of vulnerability to the plot's tension-charged atmosphere.\nWelles' directorial genius shines throughout the film, exemplified in the famous opening shot: a single, unbroken three-minute take that is as suspenseful as it is technically impressive. His innovative use of camera angles, shadow, and sound creates an atmospheric setting that truly brings the narrative to life.\n""Touch of Evil"" boasts striking cinematography, marked by deep shadows, skewed angles, and stark contrasts that capture the essence of film noir. The eclectic score, ranging from lively mariachi music to hauntingly eerie compositions, complements the visual storytelling effectively.\nHowever, the real triumph of ""Touch of Evil"" lies in its ability to provoke thought. It doesn't merely serve as a gripping mystery; it offers a profound exploration of the human condition, illustrating how the road to hell can often be paved with good intentions.\nThat said, the film is not without its share of potential drawbacks. Some viewers might find its complex narrative structure and moral ambiguity challenging to follow. Additionally, the decision to cast Heston as a Mexican officer, while a testament to his acting prowess, may seem questionable from today's perspective.\nYet, despite these potential criticisms, ""Touch of Evil"" remains an undeniable masterpiece in the realm of film noir. Its ability to blend a riveting plot with masterful cinematography, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes leaves a lasting impression.\nIn conclusion, ""Touch of Evil"" is a tour de force of cinematic artistry that transcends its genre. It is a movie that makes you think, feel, and appreciate the depth of human complexity, all while immersing you in a world of suspense and intrigue. Whether you're a fan of film noir or simply a lover of fine cinema, ""Touch of Evil"" is a must-watch that continues to resonate with audiences to this day.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b104,tt0052311,Touch of Evil,CinemaSerf,13 April 2023,7,"We start with a man putting a bomb in a car on the Mexican side of the border. When it explodes on the American side flattening the occupants, the local ""Capt. Quinlan"" (Orson Welles) decides to make a bit of a cursory investigation - in cahoots with his opposite number ""Vargas"" (Charlton Heston). Whilst they are out doing their sleuthing, ""Susan Vargas"" (Janet Leigh) is lured to a meeting with ""Uncle Joe"" (Akim Tamiroff) where it becomes clear that her husband is on the prosecuting side of a family dispute that is putting everyone in danger - something her husband finds out shortly afterwards when he narrowly avoids an acid facial. Now ""Quinlan"" and his sidekick ""Menzies"" (Joseph Calleia) have a rather unique way of working - the former intimidates just with his presence and has the District Attorney in his pocket, but as this investigation starts to spread out the original crime pails into insignificance as ""Susan"" finds herself trapped in an out of town motel and the potential victim of a ghastly drug crime that brings the threads of the story - and the true criminality to light - fatally. There are five principal characters and the actors do justice to them all - the story moves along darkly offering plenty of interest, the odd red herring and a particularly strong effort from Welles as the increasingly unlikeable policeman. I was slightly dubious about Heston playing a Mexican policeman, but here carries of the role in one of his better screen performances (when he is not wearing leather garments) and Janet Leigh - well, she was always an actor who made it all look effortless. The ending combines the scary with the brutal but will the truth be out? Big screen must for the full potency of the last twenty minutes.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b105,tt0052311,Touch of Evil,I_Ailurophile,26 March 2023,10,"Film noir is already a genre that is defined in large part by artistic flourishes in its craftsmanship to reshape and lend flavor to the crime thriller and drama. I don't think it's unfair to say that Orson Welles' vision for this feature takes that tendency to another level. From the very opening shot those minutiae that audiences often take for granted all build tension and suspense, and contribute strongly to the storytelling, as much as Welles' own adapted screenplay. Walter Murch's painstaking, somewhat unorthodox editing (in the 1998 restoration, accordingly following Welles' notes) is a wondrous gift; Russell Metty's truly exquisite, sharp, dynamic cinematography quite makes this worth watching all by itself; the precise use of light and shadow has rarely felt more alive in a film; Welles' meticulous fundamental orchestration of shots and scenes is some of the most gratifyingly robust direction to readily come to mind. From the very start, in even the most basic of ways, 'Touch of evil' is an extraordinary, captivating picture that demands viewer engagement as much for the intricacy of its construction and plot, and the excellence thereof, as for the swiftness of the pacing. For those very same reasons this is marginally challenging, but all the more terrific for the fact of it. This has a very high reputation, and it's fully deserved; frankly, this is surely one of the greatest of all film noir titles, if not altogether one of the best movies ever made.\nThere are times when the marvel of the work behind the scenes, including production design and filming locations, threatens to overshadow other elements to some degree. And that's saying a lot, because the acting is strikingly potent. From one scene to the next a different actor may stand out most, but across the board everyone gives a smart, rather intense performance that holds fast our attention. Given the most time on-screen naturally Janet Leigh, Charlton Heston, and Welles stand out most, with stark poise and force of personality, and particularly noteworthy nuance and range in Leigh's case. Yet even those in smaller supporting parts all distinctly stand out in their own ways, lending tremendously to the raw tenor of the tableau, including Joseph Calleia, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Dennis Weaver, and more. And yet, for as great as the acting is, and for as exceptional as the craftsmanship is, still the writing is possibly more darkly vibrant and ferocious. Noir commonly goes to grim forbidding places with a harsh miasma of foul figures, dirty deeds, and bad business, spiraling ever outwards and downwards. It hardly seems plausible, but 'Touch of evil' becomes more terrible yet - if not outright bleak - in a tale of utmost corruption, abuse of power, and lack of accountability. Every facet of the screenplay bristles with biting electricity that keeps us firmly locked in through every seedy turn, to the point that for as much as Welles earned his esteem as both an actor and a director, his shrewd wit as a writer may actually have been greater yet.\nFurthermore, it seems impossible to talk about this picture without also mentioning the original music of Henry Mancini. Every theme to greet our ears resounds with vivid clarity that feeds stupendously into the gnawing, clamorous airs otherwise achieved. A score is always important to any movie, even when it sticks to the background, but some immediately pop out more than others. Though no singular instance may stick out from Mancini's work here, let there be no doubt that Welles' masterpiece surely couldn't be the incredible tour de force that it is without these compositions. And that's kind of the real takeaway here: nothing in 'Touch of evil' is superfluous, and there is no part without which it could be complete, because this is a perfect creation. It's immensely absorbing, entertaining, and satisfying as a viewer despite and because of its gloomy narrative, its riveting acting, its rich music, and the fastidious, careful, fabulously attentive contributions of every last person operating behind the scenes. I could easily imagine the feature being broken down frame by frame for analysis of its composition, and to do so would be a worthy pursuit for the supreme mindfulness with which the production was approached. By all means, I assumed I would enjoy this based on what I knew of it ahead of time, and still I'm totally blown away; it cannot be overstated how utterly superb this title is. Given the dour subject matter and story I can maybe understand how it won't readily appeal to all comers, but some movies supersede questions of personal preference. In all honesty 'Touch of evil' is something that everyone owes it to themselves to watch at least once, and I can't offer any recommendation higher than that.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,
6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b106,tt0052311,Touch of Evil,adamjohns-42575,19 January 2023,6,"Touch Of Evil (1958) -\nThis was the best performance I have ever seen from Orson Welles. Up until this point I had been very disappointed with 'Citizen Kane' (1941), 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947), 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942) and 'The Third Man' (1949) and as such I could not for the life of me understand why he was so well regarded by the film industry and critics. For instance, all of those films mentioned were featured on Stephen Schneider's Top 1001 films list.\nPerhaps if the reverence for Mr. Welles was based on just this film and others that he might have done with a similarly fantastic performance I would understand, because Orson WAS very good in this one and really he lead the whole film for me. These are all things that I never thought that I would hear myself saying about the man, having not just disliked his other roles and films, but found them to be awful. Needless to say that I was a little bit surprised, but happily so.\nHowever, another actor that I have never been fond of, Charlton Heston, didn't improve my opinions of his abilities with his performance in this film, because he was as wooden as ever and didn't come across as Mexican in any way at all. It might have been better if he had at least had an accent, because it was harder to believe the dispute between them based on his ethnic background and thus the whole racial issue was much less clear due to it.\nI did think that Marlene Dietrich in her role of Tanya needed a bigger part though. I liked her character and thought that there was more to discover about her, almost as if she might be the focus of the next episode, if it had been a TV series and they were trying to spread out some of the mystery.\nAnd I did have to feel for poor Janet Leigh who never seems to have had a good time of it at roadside motels.\nThe filming style was as if the Director didn't want to have the same shot for more than a few seconds at a time and was somewhat like a game of tennis to watch, backwards and forwards all the time from face to face, car to building, Etc. I got whiplash at some points.\nAnd there were some other odd touches that didn't seem to be necessary to the plot, but I supposed added colour.\nTheir was a weird bit with a wig and then a blind woman in a shop and also a very small lift. I wasn't sure why they put them in. Maybe they were just trying to distract the audience from the rest of the mystery with extraneous information, but it just stuck out to me.\nI did feel that because the film appeared to be quite rushed that there were bits that weren't given their full time to sink in for the viewer, so there were points where I wasn't sure if I'd missed something, as other things progressed. As soon as one thing was revealed, another thing was uncovered and I was still thinking about the first thing, if you catch my drift.\nIt was also quite brutal for it's time, the violence seemed more than the usual for a 1958 film and it was added to by the music, which was a bit loud and overwhelming. I supposed that was the point, because it made me anxious, corrupt police films always rile me up anyway. Where are the 'Serpico's' (1973) when you need them? Charlie tried to deliver something similar, but just couldn't pull it off.\nI was hugely impressed by this one, which was far from how I had imagined that it would turn out. I would go so far as to say that I enjoyed it. The mystery and intrigue was engaging, although I did think that a modern version could bring much more to it, without the cuts and restrictions of the studio executives and censorship of the 1950's. I'd like to see that too.\n640.15/1000.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

A recent viewing proved to me that these aren't deficiencies, they actually enhance the film, and that it's every bit as influential and groundbreaking as Citizen Kane. Orson Welles is magnificently corrupt, proving that he wasn't just a good director, he was also a fine actor, capable of profound nuance with a glance or a muttered line, or a terrifying facial expression. I don't know anything about the process of filmmaking, but to direct and act in your own film must require a certain amount of skill, madness, or both. I had to laugh at what is at least the second time that Janet Leigh is stuck with a creepy innkeeper, and Dennis Weaver is ten times creepier than Anthony Perkins was in Psycho. The end scene is a case study in suspenseful filmmaking, and I have to wonder how long it took to film....everyone talks about the innovative opening shot, but the end scene is shot from so many angles that Welles must have exhausted every single vantage point in order to nail it down. I came away impressed this time around, and I think it's a great tragedy that Welles's career took him down some different roads in the years ahead, who knows what he could have accomplished if he had been just as committed to his artistry as he clearly was for this film.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

If you've only seen a couple of modern biopics about the famous sex symbol, this won't give you the most accurate impression of her screen persona. You might want to rent it after Gentlemen Prefer Blondes or How to Marry a Millionaire.\nThis wasn't her usual role, but I appreciated seeing her in it, because I've read enough biographies to realize she wasn't the innocent victim she wanted to appear to be. In Niagara, she's Joseph Cotten's unhappy and unfaithful wife. Joe does have some mental problems, but when Marilyn cries on people's shoulders to gain sympathy, perhaps she's overplaying her hand. Her latest targets: honeymooners Jean Peters and Max Showalter. They're staying in a nearby bungalow by the falls, and their joyous vacation is dampened by Marilyn and Joe's baggage.\nFilmed on location, you'll get to see fun scenery like the Maid in the Mist boat tour and the climb up to the falls. Director Henry Hathaway certainly had his hands full, with the slick watery conditions and a notoriously difficult leading lady. This thriller is relatively exciting, even though it's not perfect.

With this combination every scrap of the picture's terrific details pop out all the more, a real pleasure to take in as a viewer. Through Joe MacDonald's equally vivid cinematography, and director Henry Hathaway's keen eye for orchestrating arresting shots and scenes, we get lush eyefuls of the beautiful filming locations and lovely production design and art direction, to say nothing of fantastic costume design and hair and makeup work. The cast give excellent performances all around, characterized by strong, nuanced range and personality, and it's a pleasure to watch them at work. Jean Peters, Casey Adams, Joseph Cotten, and Marilyn Monroe stand out most, of course, given the most time on-screen, but the supporting actors are hardly to be counted out as the likes of Russell Collins and Don Wilson make big impressions in their own right.\nSlivers of film noir and mystery flavor the proceedings at various points - shady figures, dark dealings, murder most foul, events spiraling out of control - before the sharp tension and suspense of the thriller definitively take over. Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch, and Richard Breen penned an outstanding story and screenplay, giving us characters, dialogue, scene writing, and plot development that buzz with fierce energy as the tale unfolds. One doesn't always know what to expect from such fare, and not all features are made equal, but 'Niagara' firmly holds our attention all the way through. The visuals engage us first during early exposition, before the capabilities of the actors become most dominant. When at last the full force of the narrative takes over, brimming with all the potency that had been building, the result is fabulously absorbing and entertaining, and one can never be entirely sure where it's all going to end up.\nThere's no one aspect of the movie that immediately leaps out as essential and grabbing, despite the all-around excellence. Rather, every component part and every participant on hand - writing, direction, acting, contributions from behind the scenes - help the strength of the picture to gather over its length until at last, like an inexorable current, the viewing experience is inescapably captivating. I can't remember the last time I ended up almost literally biting my nails during a film, but that's exactly the type of storytelling we get in the last minutes. I don't know if I'd say this is absolutely perfect, or an absolute must-see, yet nor can I think of any specific fault that detracts from the experience. It's quite safe to say that this earns a true blanket recommendation; anyone who enjoys entertainment media of any sort will surely find much to love about 'Niagara,' and for anyone who especially admires film noir or thrillers, there's no doing without it.

Kubrick himself adapted Lionel White's novel ""Clean Break"" together with Jim Thompson (The Getaway), and the end result became a tight and suspenseful little film which has stood the test of time remarkably well. Even in the segments where its affinity with contemporary genre movies remain the most prevalent, such as with regards to the Sherry character, the movie has layers and nuance, not least represented through Elisha Cook's delicate George Peatty character. And the gritty, no-nonsense depiction of the crime plot gives the movie an instant appeal. The young Kubrick was equal amounts economical and visionary, which he demonstrated emphatically here on a shoestring budget in what was his first film with producer James B. Harris. They did it again a year later with the brilliant Paths of Glory.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b118,tt0049406,The Killing,frankde-jong,14 September 2023,8,"""The killing"" (1956) is the first real serious production of Stanley Kubrick. It is a film noir.\nThe general opinion is that Kubrick, in this phase of his career, was a follower of genre conventions and not yet an innovator. The film is praised above all for its craftsmanship.\nOne element that in my opinion is nevertheles innovative is the way the story (a heist on a horserace track) is told. The story is not told in chronological order but seen from the perspective of the different members of the heist-team. This means that each episode from the story is told sevaral times, but each time seen from a different perspective. Images from the horses walking to their starting position indicates that there has been a change in perspective.\nThis way of telling a story is also used in ""Satantango"" (1994, Bela Tarr), but with a running time of 7h, 19m Tarr had all the time in the World to tell a (minimalist) story from different perspectives. In other reviews I read that Quentin Tarantino borrowed this way of telling a story from Kubrick and used it in ""Reservoir dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp fiction"" (1994).\nIn the instance of ""The killing"" the way the story is told has a close connection with the story itself. The story is told from the perspective of the individual teammembers, but these teammembers are informed by the mastermind of the heist (Johnny Clay played by Sterling Hayden) on a strictly need to know basis. One member is told to start a quarrel at the bar just to distract the attention, and this is all he knew. One can't help to wonders if the way Johnny Clay manages the members of his heist team is not a bit like the way Stanley Kubrick manages his actors in his future films.\nOf course even a perfect planning (the voice over keeps giving detailed time indications) is no match for the whims of fate. At the end of the film the whims af fate appear in the form of a little dog. Curious enough I recently saw a film in which the whims of fate took the same shape (""The hidden room"", 1949, Edward Dmytryk).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

This is one of his good ones.\nBefore Tarantino and Nolan did the same, here he told the same story from different vantage points to let the audience figure out, not just what's going on, but to see the intricate planning of the job and wonder how it's going to turn out.\nThe ""genius"" of Tarantino in Pulp Fiction is to set up a story line and then deviate from expectation in a shocking way, gimps in cellars, cpr with hypodermic etc. There is a wonderfully tense and unexpected scene in The Killing where the goon tasked with shooting the race horse faces the most unexpected and unstoppable of foes: Luck, here personified in a genial security guard brandishing the most potent of lucky symbols: a horseshoe. A horseshoe at a racetrack, piercing a tyre, and so puncturing the most elaborate of criminal planning bubbles. And on such simple twists of fate the outcome of the most diligent of criminals become completely unstuck.\nOf course, such plays on verisimilitude are, thanks to modern movies shamelessly pilfering past classics, to be expected rather than lauded. Which is fine, it means everyone had to raise their game.

Ted de Corsia puts in an appearance which brings up the question was Elisha Cook or Ted de Corsia in more famous film noirs? The ending is fit for a Greek tragedy.\nThis is a great late classical period film noir. It's very low budget, experimental, and requires a modicum more suspension of disbelieve than most films.

This is a riveting movie about the meticulously planned robbery of a racetrack that is told from different points of view.\nSterling Hayden is Johnny, who recently was sprung from jail but decides to carry out the ambitious robbery, enlisting both employees of the track (including another weasel-like character played by Elisha Cook Jr.), a member of the police force, and two other friends, to carry out the robbery.\nKubrick moves from the neon nights of New York City found in his previous film, Killer's Kiss, to the sun-washed days of Los Angeles for The Killing. All of the action takes place during the day, and as was the case for his previous film, even the smallest detail in the story serves a purpose.\nThe different viewpoints of the action has been mimicked famously by other directors, particularly Quentin Tarantino, but this is not a show-offy approach. With so many players in the caper, Kubrick shows not only how their role is critical for the robbery, but also the back stories of some of the gang members. Cook's character has a gold-digging wife who's cheating on him with Columbia Pictures' character actor (and soon to be Dr. Ben Casey) Vince Edwards. The wife shares the robbery plan with Edwards and that plants the seed for the caper's eventual outcome.\nJohn Cassavetes and Kubrick both employed the bizarre character actor Timothy Carey, who has a significant part in this movie as one of the robbery gang members. His interaction with a by-the-book Black parking lot attendant, and Carey's fate, is one of the highlights of the movie. Carey would play a more sympathetic, but equally weird, character in Kubrick's next movie, Paths of Glory.\nSterling Hayden is, well, Sterling Hayden, another actor in the small club of actors who worked with Kubrick more than once. His character is a second cousin to the one he played 6 years earlier in John Huston's Asphalt Jungle - Hayden could excel at a level of realistic grittiness that more famous actors like Humphrey Bogart could not always pull off. Hayden's character in this film is tough, quiet, aloof, and all about business, and must've been studied by up and coming actors at the time such as Steve McQueen.\nPerhaps the one negative of the film is the voiceover narration that sounds like something out of Dragnet. Kubrick would later criticize the use of the voiceover but seeing how popular Dragnet was at the time, both on TV and on the radio, it made sense as to why the studio insisted on its inclusion. Overall, a real powerhouse of a movie and a must-watch for the fan's directors.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b123,tt0036342,Shadow of a Doubt,mossgrymk,20 October 2023,9,"Hitchcock's first great American film and his personal fave of all his work, ""Shadow"" is actually a fairly atypical offering from this lively but grim director. It is not particularly suspenseful, a la ""Notorious"" or ""North By Northwest"". It is not gruesome like ""Psycho"" or tongue in cheek/gruesome like ""Rear Window"". It does not flat out terrify you like ""The Birds"". And it is certainly not as interestingly sick and twisted as ""Vertigo"" or ""Strangers On A Train"". What it is is a rather quiet, brooding study of the clash of good and evil in a small town that is completely and utterly captivating. Your backside may not be on the edge of the seat but your eyes will certainly be glued to the screen.\nThree performances stand out. In ascending order let us begin with Patricia Collinge as Uncle Charlie's emotionally fragile sister. Through this sensitive portrayal emerges not only great psychological damage but, for me at least, intimations of incest, as well. Then there is Joseph Cotten's acute study in moral deadness as the idealized Uncle Charley. From the first time we see this awful fellow, lying fully clothed, cigar in mouth, on top of his cheap rooming house bed, staring vacantly at the ceiling, and hear his monotonal, utterly lifeless ""Come in"" when his landlady knocks we understand that Charley Oakley is a person who long ago checked out of life and now it's just a matter of burying the corpse before it can do further damage. Finally, and most compellingly, there is Teresa Wright's amazingly good turn as Charlie's first adoring, then appalled niece, the good to his evil. It is never easy to play Good, especially intelligent good as called for here, and avoid falling into the twin traps of sentimentality and smugness. That Wright does so triumphantly not only gives this movie its strong moral center but is also, in my opinion, evidence for this being the best female acting job in a Hitchcock film (with apologies to all you Bergman, Fontaine, Kelly or Novak fans out there).\nThree relatively minor complaints. They are:\n1)Two comic relief scenes with Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn is one too many.\n2) The child actor playing Wright's sister is so annoying that I kinda wished Cotten had detoured from his usual matronly victims to throttle the brat.\n3) Macdonald Carey is one dull actor.

When her uncle, Joseph Cotten, comes for his first visit in years, she is delighted. Then she comes to realize that he is a serial killer.\nEveryone has a favorite Hitchcock movie, and this is mine. The image of a small town, quiet and a bit stuffy, with Miss Wright's pleasantly dull family -- father Henry Travers, twittery mother Patricia Collinge, smart and bookish Edna May Wonacott, and youngster Charles Bates -- seem so normal, and pretty much are. They're also loving and accepting and so utterly clueless and a murderer slips into their midst unawares. It's a theme Hitchcock would use many times, but never quite as well as with this script by Thornton Wilder and Sally Benson.\nMiss Wright is perfect in her role, and Cotten is pretty good. Hitchcock apparently considered Cary Grant, who would have been quite adept, but his accent would have made it ridiculous. Apparently he tried to get William Powell for the role, and he would have been excellent, but MGM wouldn't lend him to Universal. Hitchcock's sly and macabre humor is on full display with Travers and next-door neighbor Hume Cronyn discussing ways to kill each other, and the location shooting in Santa Rosa, as well as DP Joseph Valentine's occasionally dark, moving Dutch-angle shots add immeasurably to the growing sense of dread.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b129,tt0039689,Out of the Past,silasmrner,3 January 2024,10,"One sure fire way to deliver a never miss noir is adapting a solid story (Build My Gallows High) by a renowned hard-boiled author (Geoffrey Homes) and sticking close to the source material. Of course it was helped by Homes being hired on to adapt his story for the screen. Much like the Maltese Falcon and The Asphalt Jungle, where the book's narrative fabric is saved word for word in the script, the story is lifted from the stilted dialogue in far too many noirs.\nAny hint of this being run of the mill drama is further elevated by a stellar cast. Mitchum personifies a conflicted noir lead (as he does effortlessly in his other noir work.) Jane Greer may have been new to star billing, but she dishes out her devious femme fatale lines as she plays Mitchum for a sucker. At the same time she must also sidestep Kirk Douglas, her criminal boss. He is terrific despite this being one of his first meaningful roles. It's clear he's going to be an important piece of Hollywood's future. Rhonda Fleming has a small, but crucial role as another in Douglas's harem of conniving women. She shows her chops as a less prominent femme fatale in this story and it's a shame that she wasn't cast in a lead role in other noir of the period.\nThis film is the epitome of Noir and must be at the top of any such list.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

Mitchum and his girlfriend are in love, so why does he get involved with Jane Greer, who was above average in looks, but no raving beauty? The most attractive woman in the film was Rhonda Fleming, who had a minor role. People go to bed and leave the outside door to their bedroom unlocked. Who does that? Mitchum comes through the patio door into Greer's bedroom while she's sleeping. She wakes up. Is she startled? Does she scream? No, she looks at him and starts a conversation with no emotion.\nAnother time, Mitchum slips into a house while a party is going on and searches a room. The phone in the room rings. Does he leave or hide? No, he just shrugs and keeps searching, as if he didn't care that someone would come in to answer the phone and see him. And what's with all the non-stop smoking in every scene? Was the film sponsored by a tobacco company?\nCharacters did things that no one would do. Greer mentions a bar to him at their first, brief meeting. He goes to that bar everyday and sits for hours waiting for her to return. Why? Is he in love with her already? What makes him think she'll come back? Why didn't she just say when and where she'd see him again?\nHow come after his first meeting with Jane Greer he forgot all about the woman he was going to marry? Was there any significance to the boy being a deaf mute? How come Kirk Douglas lost his girlfriend and $40,000 but it didn't seem to bother him much?

It must be said that for certain vehicles notably 'Great Day in the Morning' and 'The Flame and the Arrow', one could have done with a little less finesse and a little more force but he was in his element with dark dramas and for this viewer at any rate 'Out of the Past' remains his masterpiece.\nAdapted from his own novel 'Build my Gallows high' by blacklisted writer Daniel Mainwaring under the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes, the plethora of marvellous one-liners have been contributed by collaborators Frank Fenton and a certain James M. Cain.\nEven by the standards of the time this is superb Film Noir in which Tourneur has the services of his favoured cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, a master of light and shadow and composer Roy Webb whose unobtrusive score enhances the visuals without assailing the senses. Despite the leisurely pacing the film never drags and editor Samuel Beetley said of the director ""he never returned to the same camera angles when intercutting scenes"".\nRobert Mitchum, described perfectly by Roger Ebert as having ""the presence of a violent man wrapped in indifference"", is ideally cast an an existential anti-hero whilst typically of this genre, the characters played by Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming prove themselves 'more deadly than the male'. Still playing the villain at this stage of his career is Kirk Douglas whose depiction of understated menace here is extremely effective.\nThis splendid piece comes from an era when the principle of 'little is good, less is better' prevailed.

Gene Tierney was just on the cusp of stardom, ready to move on from the mostly exotic roles she had been playing, and reflecting the melancholy she felt over her newborn daughter's disabilities.

Laura is loved by men and admired or envied by women, and it is up to McPherson to sift through her relationships to try to piece together the puzzle. As he investigates her private affairs through witness testimony and private documents, he finds himself falling in love with the idea and essence of Laura. When a surprise visitor arrives at Laura's apartment a few days into the investigation, the case is turned on its head and the plot thickens.\nThere is no denying the film's glossy production values. Excellent camera-work moves smoothly through gorgeous sets, snappy dialogue is present throughout, and it is generally timed and directed with precision. The film won the Oscar in 1945 for cinematography, beating Wilder's superbly shot Double Indemnity, and it also picked up nominations for ""best supporting actor"", ""best screenplay"" and the archaic and oddly specific ""best art direction- interior decoration, Black-and-White"". Preminger also received a nomination for Best Director alongside Hitchcock and Wilder (Leo McCarey ultimately took the statue home in one of many errors in judgment by the Academy). On a technical level Laura cannot be criticised by anyone but the most pedantic of viewers.\nThe screenplay is the main thrust of a film of this type though, and although it generally delivers, it also hits a couple of bum notes. Detective McPherson is essentially an extension to the audience in the first half of the film, and he speaks to characters the viewers want to speak to, and asks the questions they want asked. The plot is teasingly unveiled, with just enough information to keep you guessing, and little enough to preseve the mystery. Just when you think you are figuring something out, another twist sheds a whole new light on things. Unfortunately though, it's a bit too clever for it's own good, and takes a few liberties to recover - ones which are deal-breakers in my opinion. I do not want to spoil the plot too much for anyone that hasn't seen this yet, but I baulked when McPherson - completely unprompted and without motive - knew exactly where the obscurely hidden murder weapon was. It was as if he had suddenly developed x-ray vision. Hints were subliminally suggested to the audience earlier in the film, but there really was no way the detective could have known about it.\nThere were a couple of other issues that I cannot really discuss in great detail without spoilers - for example an emotional level to a relationship that seems to develop in a blink of an eye. I can't say any more, but there are other flaws if you are keeping a close eye on the plot developments. I am all for a little suspension of disbelief in movies, but for a film that requires such concentration on the character and plot developments, sloppy plot-holes and a moment of Deus ex Machina should not have existed, and this left a nasty taste in my mouth.\nThe two main stars of the film, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews put in great performances, especially Andrews as the shrewd detective. The same cannot be said for supporting actor Vincent Price. It probably doesn't help that his character is a bumbling idiot, but Price delivers the lines in a very stagey, slightly awkward way and was a bit of an ambience breaker. I'm a fan of Price's later work, but his inexperience shows here.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b13d,tt0039589,Lured,SAMTHEBESTEST,10 September 2023,7,"Lured (1947) :\nBrief Review -\nNever knew this Hitchcock side of Douglas Sirk. He lured me, alright. I thought Sirk cinema meant soap, drama and romance, and he just destroyed my notion with his thriller noir Lured. I'll be glad to see more surprises from his filmography on my watchlist. Lured is your substitute version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946), with an obsessive and psychotic killer playing the main antagonist. The film tells the story of a bar girl who is hired by the cops to find a homicidal psycho on a killing spree. Since she is young and beautiful, and that's what the killer is attentive to, the woman is sent on night dates/interviews to find out who that killer is. During the process, she meets a handsome, rich man and falls in love with him. Just as they are about to be married, she is exposed to several shocking pieces of evidence that tear them apart. Now here the film loses its grip on suspense. The identity of the killer is revealed too early. They should have kept it a secret until the last scene so that it would have worked as a suspense thriller. Despite this loose corner, the film keeps you engaged and very interested in the narrative. Maybe it was Sirk's idea to make things more in the film noir zone than the Hitchcock type of suspense thriller. It works both ways; it's just a matter of your choice. Lucille Ball is the shining star here. She looks breathtaking, beautiful, and extremely gorgeous in every scene and the dialogue delivery is very exciting. Boris Karloff's cameo is a perfect example of putting the legacy in the right direction. Charles Coburn couldn't go wrong with any role any day; George Sanders gets the character right; and Sir Cedric Hardwicke may surprise you. Overall, Douglas Sirk has made an immensely busy film in suitable manners, and he actually understood the genre, which was contrary to his kind of filmmaking.\nRATING - 7/10*\nBy - #samthebestest.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

The storyline follows a London serial killer who targets women in personal adds. When a dancer is killed her American friend volunteers to be bait and help capture the killer.\nThis movie is directed by Douglas Sirk (Imitation of Life) and stars Lucille Ball (I Love Lucy), George Sanders (All About Eve), Boris Karloff (The Mummy), Cedric Hardwicke (The Ten Commandments), lan Napier (Marnie) and Joe Calleia (Touch of Evil).\nThis is a very clever movie and reminded me of the Hitchcock pictures from this era. This is essentially a who done it with a creepy stalker, fun characters and a subtle love story sub plot. There's some smart writing to keep moments light. I adored the crossword puzzle tie-ins. The cinematography was also well done with clever camera angles, use of lighting and shadows to create intensity. Lucille Ball was an easy character to root for and it will always be too bad Hollywood didn't allow her to have more leading roles. The conclusion was perfect for the storyline and very rewarding.\nOverall, this is an underrated crime thriller from the 40s that's a must see for fans of movies from this era.

She is drafted in by Scotland Yard to assist them in their investigation of eight girls who have gone missing over recent years; the latter being her friend. The one thing these mysteries may have in common is that each girl was written a poem before they went off the radar, and each may have responded to a lonely-hearts type ad in the newspaper. So ""Sandra"" is tasked with responding to each of these ads with a view to ensnaring our would be kidnapper/murderer (George Zucco is great as her police minder throughout this exercise). This is probably the most enjoyable phase of the film, as she encounters a few of life's more curious folks - not least a wonderful, brief, cameo from Boris Karloff - before she alights on the debonaire George Sanders (or does he alight on her?) and his business partner Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The former certainly fits the bill - he makes his romantic intentions clear from the outset, and when certain seemingly conclusive clues start to appear then Charles Coburn (""Insp. Temple"") concludes they have their man...but do they? The story is nothing new here, but the cast work well and though hardly menacing, the drama does build well to a cleverly played out endgame.

The background of a sex fiend known to authorities as the 'Poet Killer' for his habit of penning notes based on an obscure French writer, contacting young women through the personal columns, finds the female lead capably handled by Lucille Ball, as an American taxi dancer in London who joins the Yard to find the culprit after her friend becomes his latest victim. The picture thrives during this section, her first contact none other than Boris Karloff as downtrodden fashion designer Charles Van Druten, whose strange behavior (welcoming an empty house as though the place was packed) is explained by his only ally, Matilda (Ann Codee), relating the sad story of how he lost his mind once his finest creation was stolen by competitors (arriving at 24 minutes, a sequence lasting 12 minutes). Things only falter during the final third, after Lucy's engagement to suave theater impresario George Sanders, a mountain of evidence pointing to him, devastated to learn that his fiancee was apparently acting as a policewoman simply out to entrap him. Zucco's comic asides are an absolute delight, and Karloff too enjoyed this change of pace, alternately menacing and pathetic, while the surprise revelation of the killer comes as no surprise to more experienced filmgoers.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

It's not as well crafted as some thrillers of this type, but very watchable, with a flavor all its own. I like Lucy's serious roles, though her voice argues against real seriousness unless carefully subdued. She plays an American fish out of water as Sandra, an entertainer stranded in London, so her voice is no real handicap.

It seemed more like half a dozen movies instead of one. The ridiculous denouement that took up much of the latter part of the film seemed pointless, since by then it's clear who the murderer is, yet the audience is supposed to be glued to their seats as the cat and mouse game is played out, even though the mouse knows it has been caught 30 minutes before. Several long segments have absolutely nothing to do with the next. The taxi dancers sequence could have started a different movie; the foreign criminals, which I assume refers euphemistically to sex trafficking, is a film in itself. Then the ""real"" film begins when the film is 2/3's of the way through and the direction doesn't match the noir genre at all. The Boris Karloff sequence was yet another film in itself. I have never seen a more pointless, misguided film. Yet based on a review I read Sirk thought the film failed at the box office due to the change of title!

But director Nicholas Ray is too compassionate to turn his protagonist into a stereotype or a monster, and we are made to feel the loneliness and desolation that come with rage.

Having underwhelmed a pair of young autograph hunters, he resumes the mayhem by manhandling a motor mouth inside 'Paul's Nightclub.' There's an upswing in the evening's fortunes, however, with an invitation for hat check girl, Martha Stewart to join him at his apartment, in order to hear her analysis of a trashy novel. A most unconventional date, explained by the fact that Bogie is a talented, but temperamental and tempestuous screenwriter in dire need of a HIT. Unfortunately, he appears to be in a similar state of mind to Neil Young, when he wrote 'Borrowed Tune' and is only too relieved to give Stewart $20 taxi fare, sparing him the ear bashing torture of the novel's many sub-plots.\nA fate preferable, however, to winding up at police headquarters in the early hours, on suspicion of Stewart's brutal murder. Bogie's petulant indifference and track record of assaults only adds to the bad vibes until an olive branch is thrown by detective buddy, Frank Lovejoy, aware of the suspect's idiosyncratic nature, but convinced of his innocence.\nBeautiful, dutiful neighbour, Gloria Grahame, provides an alibi and soon romance blossoms. Humph, a happily changed man toils to turn the wretched book into a workable screenplay and all appears well, until.....a convivial dinner leaves all present with a nasty aftertaste, following his macabre, graphic theory behind Stewart's murder. Shortly afterwards, he goes into over reaction overdrive. The mildest provocation, a mere speck of a misunderstanding inducing an episode of crazy, reckless driving and a violent outburst of such shuddering proportions that Grahame is left feeling both shocked and threatened, ruefully reflecting on the wisdom of picking Bogie for a lover.\nDon't look here for pulsating, rip-roaring, breathless, wall to wall action, or frenzied, bite yer fingernails down to the elbows suspense.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b14f,tt0042593,In a Lonely Place,malvernp,28 June 2023,8,"Humphrey Bogart gave us his great ""Psychopath Trilogy"" in the short space of only six years: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950) and The Caine Mutiny (1954). The first (and probably the best known and most admired of the three films) involved Bogart's memorable creation Fred C. Dobbs. He was a decidedly paranoid and disturbed man with clearly defined anti-social tendencies, who also often talked to himself when agitated. The third (which presented perhaps the most pathetic and sympathetic of the three leading man roles) introduced us to the famous Captain Queeg----a middle aged veteran naval officer who had been in one too many battles, and as a result slowly became unhinged in the performance of his normal duties to the point that a sober but foolish subordinate officer instigated the title mutiny. But the second (and least known film in the trilogy) challenged Bogart to perform probably the most complex and difficult character of the three movies as screenwriter Dix Steele-----a man of considerable warmth, taste and sensitivity who was also saddled with a.dangerous and violent nature that could suddenly erupt into actions that were highly reckless and sometimes quite destructive in their consequences.\nIn a Lonely Place (IALP) featured a mature and almost charismatic individual, who under the right set of circumstances could project significant charm and likability. But if Steele were ever confronted by an unexpected issue that upset him and stressed him out------his nature could undergo a traumatic and often menacing change for the worse. IALP's story spins a tale about how such a character reacted to personal problems that arose when he fell in love with a budding actress named Laurel Gray (played winningly by Gloria Grahame). As Bogart's psychopathic writer gets deeper into his relationship with Laurel and finds himself becoming dominated by conflicted feelings involving a lack of trust that leads to furious rage-----he descends into an unpleasant world of violence. In IALP, Bogart revealed his great art as an actor by making it completely believable for Steele to go from a pleasant fellow to an off-putting monster without loosing a beat. It is a spectacular performance-----one of his very best. Lauren Bacall was originally sought to play Laurel-----but Warner Brothers would not agree to the loan out arrangement. This fortuitous circumstance allowed the often underestimated Grahame to play perhaps the finest part of her career------certainly much better than her Oscar awarded role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952).\nIALP is one of Nicholas Ray's most celebrated films, and he also contributed (uncredited) to the engrossing screenplay by Andrew Solt. IALP has a strong supporting cast featuring Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Donnell, Art Smith and Carl Benton Reid. Only Robert Warwick as the alcoholic elderly Shakespearian actor is a distraction with his somewhat over the top performance. The cinematography of Burnett Guffey should be singled out for special praise with its moody black and white presentation.\nIALP is a film that Bogart wanted to make, and he gives us in Dix Steele a character that probably comes the closest to reflecting his real life persona. Perhaps this may explain why Bogart did not particularly like the movie. In any event, IALP is a major artistic and critical success that has continued to gain in stature since its initial release. How much of Dix Steele ultimately crept into Bogart's later conception of Captain Queeg is a question best left to the consideration of his many appreciative fans.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b47,,,,,

On the contrary, it casually pans over the daily life of a Nazi household, which, for certain of its members, is nothing short of heavenly despite being located just outside Auswitz's concentration camp. Instead of executions and gas chambers, the viewer is greeted with Sunday family excursions, pool parties and nonchalant discussions over garden grooming. Take away the Nazi attire and the camp's fernace, always so cleverly glooming in the background, and the film could literally be about any other mundane family. It is that mere irony and contradiction that set the tone for the whole film, which ultimately relies on the viewers' empathy and previous knowledge of the horrors of the Holocaust, without actually having to delve into any of them itself.\nTo be clear, this is not a watch for casual moviegoers who opt for a war movie with powerful dialogue. The camera work is excellent, the acting is on point, albeit rather subtle, yet the narration plays out more so as an observational documentary with, admittedly, slow pacing and a lack of considerable climactic events.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs.

As a student of Judaism, the theme of the Holocaust passionates me, and the premise of the film seemed brilliant, and I was really looking forward to it. I started to have a slight suspicion when we were treated to five minutes of a black screen with ominous music just after the opening credits.\nTo be fair, the film does have some amazing ideas; all four of them would have made a wonderful, thought-provoking twenty minute short. As a feature film, they are not enough. After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

This is not a feel-good theatrical production, but it's very much a cynical celebration of cinema and it's dreamers, with all the theatrical flair you can imagine. Crazy unexpected moments in the movie, ranging from extreme ostentatious and depravity to extreme vulgarity and sentimentality.\nIt subtly turns a lense on the industry, and exposes how it has dehumanised and objectified people by exploiting every person's vulnerabilities, and how that in turn changes the people, and that in turn changes cinema, which in turn changes people again. And what is particularly good, is that the audience is also brought into the telling as well\nThe cycle of emotions is felt throughout the film. The promise of the American Dream never fails to deliver on that emotional rollercoaster, even if the dream results in failure.\nMy thinking is that many bad reviews may have been subconsciously annoyed that it essentially points a finger at every person.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

It's out of the question for me to split it up, so I watch it in one go and take my time. With Babylon, I waited a while and then treated myself to it, with the result that I wasn't bored for a minute. Damien Chazelle surprised me, because I was expecting an acid trip à la Baz Luhrmann. But that wasn't the case. The scene with the elephant was a successful introduction to the film's drastic humor, which at the same time takes the absurdity of early Hollywood to the extreme, reaching its first climax in the battle scenes of the monumental film shot later. And it doesn't really end there. I can't agree with some of the things that have been written here about the sexual permissiveness, but maybe that's because I'm European and I'm more upset by violence. It's there too, but in sparing doses. I see the movie much more as a loving homage to a crazy industry that holds nothing sacred and sometimes sacrifices people for the sake of success. Margot Robbie at the center of it all is fantastic, the rest of the cast does a good job too, and the score is an absolute feast for the ears. A bit too long, all that?

Gladly, the storyline was very well written and well-explained. Also, the characters were very interesting and well-developed. The casting of the movie was amazing and their acting was excellent (Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt nailed it). Moreover, the 1920's were very well portrayed, especially the outfits and the music. I have to admit, it was an expectedly very intense movie, full of nudity, blood and drugs. The opening scene was 30 minutes long, very chaotic, well edited and really promising.

The story takes place in 1920s, but the only parts that were 1920s were the older cars (which are depicted not so impressive covered in dust), and not the people or the fashion or how they were back then (they aren't that direct especially the women). People were too skinny (in other words too modern as people aren't too skinny or obese like in modern America), oozing with fakeness and not the authenticity. I think I know why the movie wasn't successful or didn't really offset the budget of estimated $110 million even from the box office alone, and I saw this on the Netflix just today not even 1 year after the movie release in theaters. They didn't do well as it is not well made, that's why it became available not even a year after the actual release date on Netflix...it was not a hit. I can understand why, the scenes are just too far violent, story unrealistic (in a bad way oozing fakeness) and uninteresting, and nothing revealing or appealing or realistic about them; especially the scenes people supposedly died for real in the making of movies?? Yeah right, that's just murders. Umm, no, people didn't die in reality back then just like that, and not ok to lead the world to think people in poverty from the skid row were ""picked up"" (or recruited) to be treated like their lives were worthless as they either died/horrifically injured on the set...what's the message here?? Like did the director think this is something we wanted to watch and enjoy?? Seriously lacking what we want to watch, we want to be entertained, we do not want to watch horror scenes or depressive scenes one after another. Not fun or thrilling. Nothing. No stunt men back then and people were picked up on the streets to die for the movie making industry?! That never happened in reality, and it is a horrible storyline. The movie scenes look like clips of nightmares of a drug addicted or alcohol dependent movie director of some sorts, it is just not entertaining at all. The scenes aren't appealing, it evoked yuck feeling just by watching half of it. I do not recommend it. The worst part of this?

This is the adaptation of a different book covering the story of the Andes survivors - another take on the same real-life event.\nAs directed by J. A.

With limited resources, harsh conditions, and dwindling hope, they must forge a fragile community and confront the unthinkable choices necessary to stay alive. (Bard AI)\nHow far would you go to survive? Where would the boundaries of morality be for you? In 1972, a team of rugby players and other passengers had to deal with these questions when Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed in the Andes under extreme weather conditions. This movie tells their story. And it's a gripping and suspenseful one.\nThe physical and psychological suffering of the crash survivors is expertly depicted in Society of the Snow. Every decision they have to make is a cliffhanger. The young cast all deliver raw and nuanced portrayals of their breakdowns and moments of resilience. It is heartbreakingly honest. And the snowy landscapes and harsh beauty of the Andes are visually stunning and add to the immersive and unsettling atmosphere of the film.\nOne of the most intense aspects of the Society of Snow is the way it grapples with complex questions about survival and the limits of human nature. These are unavoidable problems, and forcing survivors to make these choices has a harsh and direct effect on them. The deftly mixed excitement of survival scenes with peaceful contemplation draws us into the characters' inner journeys.\nThe film's slow pacing, which is intentional and intricate, may occasionally test some viewers' patience. There is graphic content that is realistically rendered and may cause distress to certain individuals. The movie leaves a few questions unsolved, which may irritate some viewers. And the focus on the themes of death and survival may also be emotionally challenging.\nSociety of the Snow is not for the faint of heart. However, I suggest it if you are looking for a moving, provocative tale about the depths of human nature and human resilience. It is a more intense experience because it is based on a true story. Be prepared for a harrowing journey that will leave you questioning your own boundaries and the strength of the human spirit.\n-\nNOTE: This review is the result of a partnership between my creative vision and an AI tool's capabilities.

The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.\nAs a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.\nWhat seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.\nEverything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break.

King Crow, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), Amleth's father (Oscar Novak), was killed by his b*stard brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). He also took the boy's mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) as his wife and killed the joke, Heimir (Willem Dafoe), a family friend. Years pass. Amleth, now adult, should go in search of revenge. A witch (Bjork) shows the way. He will go to the north, find a sword, and make a difficult choice between his personal vended and the safety of his beloved.\nEven to support this detailed, Mise en scene preserves a very welcome theatrical aspect, backed by pauses between the choreography of the action scenes, leaving the bloodshed more visceral; in the conduct of a ""stage"" of interpretations, where the entire cast (which is excellent, despite the loaded accent) follows the far -fetched frequency of the text; and in the organized division into chapters, valuing the dynamism of assembly and its gentle transitions between temporalities and geographies. Highlight for the production design in lease, making that universe more believable and also for sound mixing, causing the ambient sounds to penetrate our ears as if we were in it, manipulating the purposely cracked - but excellent for this factor - soundtrack exactly at the moments that If you are asking for tension or doubt (for dream sequences), reinforcing this almost face -to -face immersion character from the theater.\n""The Northman"" brings such an interesting outfit to this already known structure that there is no other way to describe the feature film that is not masterful. It is cinema in its gross state, to delight for images and bring the fantastic to the worldly. This is because he is, at the same time, a faithful historical portrait of the Scandinavian peoples in the late 9th century and a portrait of their customs, presenting all their rites and beliefs. And what makes it so unique and powerful is how he can take advantage of this almost anthropological fidelity to explore the entire symbolic burden linked to each of these elements, taking advantage of this strength to make his history grow.\nWhat makes this movie so unique is how it sews these three spheres to recreate an entire culture - and this is very rare to see in the cinema. In just over two hours, he ties real and fantastic not just to impress and play with what is true or not. Also, because it doesn't matter. What is really important here is the symbolic burden of the gods, rituals, beliefs and customs, and how it all guides the life of a people. This is where the feature is so close to the myth of Campbell, but the concept of myth itself: this narrative that carries a greater meaning than the story itself. This manifests itself in the journey of revenge of the orphan prince, but also in the very ways he takes to do so. What Eggers does is bring the myth to the audience while his character lives his own. In a way as crude as it is beautiful, the director takes advantage of all symbolism and senses linked to the Nordic myths to mean his hero's journey, making ""The Northman"" a true epic in the most traditional sense of the term.\nThe plot itself of ""The North Man"" is quite simple. It is the universal history of family revenge, the old archetype of the son's struggle against Usurper Uncle. It is the lion king with Vikings or, if you prefer, a rawer and more brutal version of the classic Hamlet - and, not by chance, the main character is called Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard). But the great asset of the feature is not the originality of its script. Although it is really good, what impresses is the skins with which it wears this structure that is common to us. All the twists and situations presented on Amleth's personal journey are very well built, just as the characters are developed so that you understand each other's motivations and the pains of their losses. At this point, Skarsgard's hero is what draws the most attention. In addition to being the center of this vengeance narrative - something you buy early on, when he is still a child and disappears into the sea with a mantra of hatred and resentment - the way the actor portrays these feelings is impressive. All your gesture in battle incorporates very well the beast he has become over the years and this is critical for you to understand all your actions from that point on.\nThis is where the play between the real and the symbolic made by the director gains much more sense. Just as we see Amleth practically becoming a beast to attack a Slavic village -in an incredible sequence plan -he becomes this spirit of revenge that talks to all the beliefs of that people. And Eggers explores these different layers of significance between characters and viewer to make weight to the madness in which his hero plunges. At the same time, nothing is Manichean and as simple as a children's tale and this is something that even some characters point to Amleth and his naive worldview. Thus, it is easy to understand the motivations of villain Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and even become fond of the character he becomes from a certain moment.\nIf in the previous feature films, especially in ""The Witch"", Eggers seemed much more interested in an atmospheric terror, with a more concerned mise in creating a certain dark and uncertain suggestion in ""The Northman,"" the filmmaker does not demonstrate Any fear of dirty hands. Interest in the mystic remains present, both in scenes that mix dream, prophecy and real, working on legends, such as gods, swords and valuchirias, as when filming smoky or oppressive environments and some very slow dolly in to put us in actions. However, this time, the director seems much more willing to approach the legend as active observers. Thus, there are many plans or even close -ups of the characters, especially the protagonist, played with the savagery needed by Alexander Skarsgard, looking at the camera, suggesting a fourth wall break. It's almost as if the director told the audience: ""I'm seeing you and you will witness this story."" The same is true of the most brutal scenes in the feature, where Eggers makes a point of not hiding anything, either in the fight scenes, that he demonstrates a lot of ability to keep everything in the same long plane, or when filming the torn bodies after the attacks.\nIt is as if, while the director was putting the morale of his protagonist to the test, he also directed his gaze to the public, questioning us, in the position of Voyeur and Judge, if we will continue with this character to the end, which becomes even more interesting when new information about your father is revealed. More than that, the viscerally in ""The North Man"" is so great that it pervades us. When we realize, we are hoping the character to follow his revenge and respond violently a world where there is no room for tenderness, which is represented in the beautiful, and still brutal, moments between Skarsgard and Anya Taylor-Joy.\nEggers, who writes the feature alongside Sjón (also responsible for darling Indie Lamb), extracts from this story only the most superficial emotions. The Northman is a movie of fury, of thought, of theatricality. On the way, he slips on the notion that traditional masculinity is dictated by all these things, but is just beyond recognizing it as a cycle of violence, a lineage of nihilism created by the pure coercive force of the spilled blood. Eggers' previous film, the lighthouse, questioned the same themes well, but The Northman does not allow himself to think about himself. The result of this impulse of constant movement and emotion is a shouted but boring blockbuster. A visually resolved movie, but without shadow of the austere plastic flowers from previous Eggers onslaught. The filmmaker has never been a color wizard, but a skilled light and shadow manipulator, a user of extreme close-ups and unlocs, a born observer of intense performances. In ""The Northman"", he has time and money to be all these things, but he does not have the material with which he works significantly.\nBut the great strength of the film is the way it sews historical and symbolic elements to give a very particular weight to its plot. And this is not an easy task, even though director Robert Eggers can balance all these perspectives very well. On the one hand, he brings all the hardness of Scandinavian culture in a very faithful portrait of what these people were still in their first contacts with the rest of Europe. Everything is very gray and brown, marking not only the dirt and desolation of the environment, but the cross of the spirit of these warriors. Not coincidentally, when the action is taken to Iceland and we are presented alongside both Amleth and Fjölnir, photography leaves this grayish tone a little aside and gains some new colors.\nHowever, there is also the fantastic side of the thing and all this magical and mystical aspect of Nordic beliefs brings a life that contrasts a lot with the lifeless tone of the worldly. From the representation of the tree of life to the beautiful ride of Valkyrie, the way the mythical side is portrayed lives up to the weight it has in the life of the characters. But the director's hand is not only felt in this relationship in this mythological aspect. At a time when action movies are filled with a frantic edition and full of cuts, there is no way not to be gaping when faced with a camp battle in a sequence where the camera follows the advancement of this half-wolf warrior, half wolf and that makes it clear how fierce he is. These are not special effects that make it this figure unstoppable, only the good old acting with a competent direction.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

Unfortunately, I did not make the tour through the comments and I would have known. Oh boy, what a disappointment. This movie lives from its pictures, but even here it sometimes falls short. I think the acting was very good, but the story and character development just poor. The main character remains a strange, angry man with no feelings. The story is very simple with a twist, which is also not that surprising. Its more like a bloodbath through a dark, unfriendly world that confronts the main character with some moral dilemmas. He remains a stranger to the viewer as all other characters in the movie. One rather could feel pity for them all for having to live in such a world. Even the love is frosty in this movie. Where the movie shines most are the scenes, which portray a cold, cruel world with lot's of hardship and little sparks of hope. You can really feel the miserable weather, the cruelty, the hardship and overall coldness of the age. You will appreciate your warm couch and neighbors after having seen this.

Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman are miscast, the plot is slow, boring and disjointed, and there is no character development.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b176,tt0057115,The Great Escape,tpsimpleman,22 December 2023,10,"Title: The Great Escape (1963)\nDirector: John Sturges\nGenre: War, Drama, Adventure\nThe Great Escape is an iconic war film that tells the incredible true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war during World War II. Directed by John Sturges, this 1963 classic has become a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the most beloved films in the genre.\nThe movie follows a group of British and American soldiers who are held captive in a high-security German prison camp. Determined to regain their freedom, they plan an audacious escape attempt. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), known as ""Big X,"" they meticulously devise an elaborate plan to break out of the seemingly impenetrable prison walls.\nOne of the standout aspects of The Great Escape is its ensemble cast, featuring some of Hollywood's finest actors at the time. Steve McQueen delivers a charismatic performance as Captain Virgil Hilts, famously known for his thrilling motorcycle chase scene. James Garner portrays Lieutenant Robert Hendley, adding depth and humor to the narrative. Each character brings a unique personality and skill set to contribute to their shared objective.\nThe film excels in capturing both the camaraderie among the POWs and their relentless determination to reclaim their freedom. It beautifully balances moments of suspense with lighter comedic scenes that provide much-needed relief amidst the tense atmosphere.\nJohn Sturges' direction deserves special mention for his ability to create tension-filled sequences without resorting to excessive violence or gore commonly associated with war films. Instead, he focuses on building suspense through meticulous planning and execution while highlighting themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and resilience.\nFurthermore, The Great Escape boasts impressive production design that transports viewers back in time to WWII-era Germany. From detailed recreations of the prison camp itself to authentic costumes and props, every element adds authenticity and immersion to the story.\nWhile some may argue that the film's runtime of over two and a half hours is excessive, it allows for thorough character development and an immersive storytelling experience. The pacing remains consistent throughout, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish.\nIn conclusion, The Great Escape is a timeless war film that continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling story, memorable characters, and superb performances. It successfully manages to balance action-packed sequences with moments of heartwarming camaraderie.

Other characters were composites, but the main part of the story is close to the real events, and they used a real survivor of the camp as a technical consultant. And Donald Pleasance was eminently qualified to be POW since he was one in real life! He did say in an interview that prisoners were not as rude to heavily armed guards as in the movie - I think I would be polite to a guy with a Schmeiser submachine gun too!

Forget your Escape to Victory (1981) or Von Ryan's Express (1965) this is it!\nWhy, let's run through the film.\n1. Cast. Probably the greatest ensemble cast of Hollywood and Commonwealth acting talent ever put to film (or good use anyway). Be it the Commonwealth/British acting talent of the likes of Richard Attenborough or Hollywood heavyweights such as Steve McQueen and James Garner. Add the likes of Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and others. The list is endless. Their characters all have a vital role in the operation, hence their nicknames in the film such as The Tunnel King or The Scrounger.....\n2. Music. A rousing score by Elmer Bernstein that is still revered to this day.\n3. Length. This film is long, approximately 172 minutes. Just below epic length. It allows for all the facets of the escape operation to be played out in all their glory. Every dollar/pound or whatever is on the screen.\n4. Historical accuracy. Okay some of the more pedantic reviews may sniff about the historical accuracy but the main events happened. There is some artistic licence added to the screenplay no doubt but in what Hollywood production isn't there?\n5, The poster doesn't have little boxes of the stars faces that is so often the case in films with multiple star attractions but is ultimately a let down! Good marketing in my opinion.\nIf I have any complaints with the film (albeit minor) it is the last act featuring the escape aftermath. A completely unnecessary sequence showcasing stunt motorcycling by Steve McQueen seems tagged into the screenplay?\nIf you have a spare three hours watch this film (you probably have at some stage so enjoy it again).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

This doesn't happen every day. It's hard to believe how well The Great Escape has held up after all these years. The cast is phenomenal, the characters are very likable, and the story is engrossing. With such a long runtime, we get a chance to really get to know a lot of the characters. There are so many who play an important role in this escape attempt from a German POW camp. They turn prison escaping into an art form. It's fascinating watching all that goes into it. Oddly enough, this is the most lighthearted World War 2 POW film I've seen. There isn't much suffering shown. The prisoners are of good spirits throughout most of the story and the prison guards aren't so cruel as we normally see from such movies. It really makes you wonder why these characters are risking so much to escape. But when the time to escape comes, it's indeed suspenseful, and the suspense continues building from there. Trying to escape a German prison is one thing, but trying to escape the German occupied territory is quite another.\nThere are some thrilling on-the-run scenes.

Of these, The Great Escape is by far the most superior effort. It's a movie that presents some relatable characters, funny and touching moments, drama and tragedy, and all this based on true events (though the characters are fictional). It's an inspirational tale about a group of very different men with different talents working together for a common goal. The tone constantly shifts between comedy and tragedy, but does so in an admirable way, rarely feeling off. The film features a great ensemble cast with 'the king of cool', Steve McQueen, at the helm. It's wonderful that many of the characters are developed in a way that makes their struggles more relatable. A highlight was the unlikely friendship between James Garner's American trickster and Donald Pleasance's soft-spoken English birdwatcher characters.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b17f,tt0057115,The Great Escape,trrsb,15 May 2023,10,"Although this amazing WW2 film is based on fact, and does play with the facts a bit, it still ranks as possibly the greatest and certainly most entertaining WW2 movie ever produced. I will try to explain why.\nFirstly, the cast is not only top notch but possibly the best roles of the majority of those in the film - an amazing thing its own right. I believe you can make the case for not only McQueen but James Garner, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasance, Richard Attenborough and James Coburn who all went on to great careers as a result of their work here. McQueen and Bronson were amazing in The Magnificent 7 (1960) but I think their stardom was secured here. What a perfect ensemble.\nSecondly, the story of these brave men gives all of us a model for our own lives. The message is simple - when you have a duty to others, you do it even if it means sacrificing your own life. This is quite a hurdle for most of us, but not for the many brilliant and courageous men at Stalag 3. They were the best of the best and we knew they were right off the bat. The film does not waste time on declaring what the overriding purpose is of these men's lives, now confined. It is to escape. And they are at it barely into the first few minutes if the film. From there, it is a journey that we happily and vicariously take with them just as if we are there with shovels. The journey also has the fabulous suspense of now knowing who makes it in the end, and I will leave that to find out for the few people that have still not watched The Great Escape.\nFinally, the score by Elmer Bernstein is simply the best film score of all time. I know that is going out on the limb of hyperbole, but I will accept the challenge. I would argue that the music is not only the most memorable in its own right but the thematic variations of the score fits so perfectly within the variety of scenes and emotions of the men, individually and as group. I was 8 years old when this film was first shown on network TV. It's hard to keep 8 yr old boys attentive for a movie as long as this one clocked out, but I was hooked from beginning to end. The next day in school, the kids were humming that tune and had found a new hero to emulate next to James Bond in Steve McQueen.\nInteresting trivia - McQueen not only did most of the finale's motorcycle stunts (except the big leap, for insurance purposes not allowed) but also switched roles and played the very Germans that were after him - on their bikes. Cool.\nAs a sidebar, I may be the first one to get this connection as I have not seen anyone catch it, but here goes. McQueen's swashbuckling motorcycle riding character Hilts was called ""The Cooler King"" by his comrades because he never quit doing the things he did to get in the ""Cooler"". Maybe that was why he was henceforth called the ""King of Cool? I don't think that's a coincidence.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

The slapstick comedy with religion was pretty clever, but it didn't make up for a lot of the unexplained hijinks throughout the film.

Indeed The Favourite surprises because it is excellently written, never shying away from anachronistic vulgarities and a honest but painfully brash and hilarious sense of humour. For Lanthimos, this is probably standard stuff. But by mainstream Hollywood conventions, this is bold, creative, and inventively funny. The backstabs, the plotting, the connivance are all approach is a cynically funny way. The Favourite is also perhaps notable for being a film where the females are the ones in power. The trio of leading women are all excellent in their portrayals. Olivia Colman is wonderful as Queen Anne, playing an unhinged, infantile, and uninterested queen. She is emotionally unstable but extremely powerful- the worst combination for her subordinates, but the best combination for our entertainment. Rachel Weisz is likewise brilliant as the conniving, scheming Lady Marlborough. Marlborough is the secret puppeteer who pulls the queens strings and her approach is evil, almost Machiavellian in her manipulation of the queen. But perhaps the most fascinating character is Abigail, played by the magnificent Emma Stone. The story could be seen as the transformation of the initially meek Abigail into a plotting, morally bankrupt schemer who becomes the queens Favourite. Initially Abigail plots to ensure her continued survival, but her lust for power eventually turns her into something more sinister. I think to say Lanthimos is a unconventional director would be a massive understatement. But The Favourite, crazy as it is, is genuinely funny, dripping with wry cynicism, and very enjoyable. This film has a great deal of mainstream appeal, and is a pleasure to watch.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

Scenes between Sarah Churchill and Lord Bolingbrock (Kirill Lavrov) are pure delight. As for this movie, it is just naturalistic and ugly stuff, made about parodies of human beings.

6595b4dfa783f0cdafc9b185,tt5083738,The Favourite,frankde-jong,16 November 2023,7,"Yorgos Lanthimos is well known for absurd movies such as ""The lobster"" (2015) and ""The killing of a sacred deer"" (2017). It is almost a surprise when he makes a rather (but not completely) normal movie. ""The favourite"" (2018) is such a movie.\nUnlike his previous two films, ""The favourite"" is definitely a genre movie, the genre being a costume drama and the subgenre a film about the English royal family.\nWith respect to the costume drama's the film reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975, Stanley Kubrick), especially in the beautiful way it covers candle light, which was of course a much harder to do in 1975 than in 2018.\nWith respect to films about the English royal family I immediately think about Shakespeare adaptations. This association is not fully unjustified because, just like a Shakespeare adaptation, the film is all about palace intrigues. The only difference is that in this case the intrigues are between three women. This is not without importance because it gives the film a touch of the flavor of ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph L. Mankiewicz).\nThe story is about Queen Anne (1655 - 1714), but does not claim any historical accuracy. Queen Anne is in poor health and entrusts government activities to her adviser Sarah Churchill. During the film the position of Sarah is challenged by her impoverished cousin Abighail Hill. So the fight is not about being King / Queen, like in so many royal dramas, but about the possibility to manipulate the reigning Queen. See also ""A royal affair"" (2012, Nikolaj Arcel). The risk of such a fight is thet you can never be sure that you have really won. In my opinion that is the message from the much criticized final scene. The one who thought she has won finds out that the Queen can not always be manipulated in the desired direction.\nQueen Anne is played by Olivia Colman, Sarah Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and Abighail Hill is played by Emma Stone. All of them are giving a terrific performance. My ""favourite"" is Olivia Colman, portraying Queen Anne as vulnerable at some times, headstrong at other times but at no time caricatured. Olivia Colman got an Oscar for actress in a leading role, the other two ""only"" got a nomination for actress in a supporting role.\nMany reviewers mention the good performance of the lead actresses. Apart from their own merit this is also attributable to the more natural dialogue compared to earlier films of Lanthimos. I do agree with these reviewers, but strangely enough this is one of the reasons I prefer those earlier films. ""The favourite"" is just too normal for a real Lanthimos.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

The feature film dethroned the novel as the culturally dominant storytelling form in the middle of the last century. Now, of course, it has lost that exalted throne to peak TV. But there's always a lag time and money to made pretending that the Empress's clothes are exquisite.\nThis is the worst sort of movie--high pretentious. The script abounds with witling tit-for-tat wisecracks learned from sitcoms, not good ones. There are puerile anachronisms that should embarrass the filmmakers, though they may be immune. Perhaps they calculate: it doesn't really matter what we write. The costumes and history and all the snobbery about English accents will get us a win in Los Angeles. What an artistically bankrupt enterprise.\nThe Favourite pretends to be a deep, intelligent study of how character shapes history, a nations' destiny--of how desire injects power with purpose, discovering political meaning. The creators of this shallow crap no doubt read great novels, saw great movies when they were young. So they aspire to greatness, but lack the mind or honest inclination, really. They just want to be SEEN as great. That wins awards!\nAwards tell you what you should revere. And there were feature films deserving of it, in the past. But now the prestige awards are lavished on outright junk like '3 Billboards,"" for example, and this stupefying sub-mediocrity.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b18b,tt21867434,BlackBerry,gortx,2 January 2024,No rating,"Right at the top, BLACKBERRY notes that it is a 'fictionalization' even though it's based on a non-fiction book and names names. Straight off, one can see that the tone will be off-kilter. Director, Co-Writer (with Matthew Miller) and Co-star Matt Johnson takes a freaks and geeks approach to the pair of inventors who co-founded a relatively small Canadian tech company, Research In Motion, Mike Lazaridis (Jay Barechel) and Doug Fregin (Johnson). A pitch meeting gone bad to a much larger firm, nevertheless ends up attracting the interest of a mid-level executive who sees potential in their idea for what would become the title device. Jim Basillie (Glen Howerton) is portrayed as an over-the-top shark who takes advantage of the boys' naivete. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.\nJared Raab's jittery camera, Jay McCarrol's dynamic score and several choice song cuts by the likes of Joy Division, The Strokes and Elastica create a feeling of semi-controlled chaos as the modest firm eventually creates what can now be termed the first Smartphone. It's success leads to it being nicknamed the 'Crackberry'. The screenplay stays focused on the business end. Save for a very brief scene in Basillie's then modest home, the characters have no personal lives to speak of. Women are barely scene (so much so, that Johnson makes an amusing visual jab out of it). Johnson also is smart to tone down the frenetic camera and editing once the movie gets more serious (it is a rise AND fall story after all).\nThe cast is quite good here despite the lack of any real backstory. Howerton in particular relishes his Type A scene chewing. Michael Ironside has a loud supporting role as an operations manager who takes particular delight in knocking down the tech nerds a peg - calling them ""children'.\nBLACKBERRY is as deep as a detailed text (something with Blackberry first made practical), and inaccuracies abound, but it's a highly enjoyable rags to riches story. It may not be a 'just the facts version of events' -- but, it does entertain, and most importantly, it does get at the 'truth' in it's own skewed way.\nNote: This is a review of the feature film version, not the AMC mini-series edition.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

Howerton and Baruchel excel in their roles, bringing a remarkable depth and realism to their characters. Their acting stands as a highlight in a film marred by a slow pace and a narrative that can often be confusing.\nThe film's treatment of crucial plot points feels rushed, glossing over significant events and leaving the audience wanting more. Particularly, it misses the opportunity to delve deeply into the seismic shift caused by the iPhone's emergence, a pivotal moment in tech history that deserved more attention.\nMoreover, an intriguing subplot, which is only briefly touched upon, is Jim Balsillie's audacious but ultimately failed attempt to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins. This episode alone could have been a riveting storyline, deserving of its own cinematic exploration. It's a missed opportunity that could have added an exciting dimension to the film.\nIn summary, ""BlackBerry"" earns a 6 out of 10. It's a film with exceptional acting and a fascinating subject but falls short in pacing and narrative clarity, and it doesn't fully capture the dramatic impact of its real-life events.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

Like, for entire scenes.\nThe one dudes fake bald hair cut was bad (although not as bad as his embarrassing over-the-top performance), the skin color was not matched, and so it just always looks like a guy with a bald head spot shaved in.\nThe dialogue was bad. No one talks like that. And also, the dialogue was stupid. How embarrassing to have to deliver such lines.\n(Some of the dialogue was so bad that in order to enjoy it we had to perceive it as hilarious. At times it was so bad we were inclined to go back and record bits of it with the cell phone so we could make it into a hilarious ringtone or something.

Some of the main characters are portrayed a bit different from reality and most of the dialog had to be fabricated but to be consistent with what transpired. From my brief research it seems the story in the movie pretty well follows what happened. Me? I never owned a Blackberry, apparently named for the tiny keyboard resembling the surface of a ripe Blackberry.\nResearch In Motion (RIM) was founded in the 1980s by two friends in Canada. The company was involved in any number of electronics contracts. But 1999 was their banner year when the Blackberry 850, a pager with a keyboard, was introduced. Then in 2002 their first smart phone, the BlackBerry 5810, hit the market. It was an instant success and quickly dominated the market for smart phones.\nWhat the RIM people didn't know was in 2007 and 2008 Steve Jobs and Apple were developing a next generation of smart phone with a touch screen pad and additional capabilities. Failing to keep up, the Blackberry share of the market went from almost 50% to less than 1% rather quickly.\nAll this is depicted rather interestingly and entertainingly in this movie. The rise and the fall of the Blackberry. To add to the realism of ""being there"" hand-held cameras are often used.

It moves at a cracking pace.\nThe movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.\nSome of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.\n""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.\nSo why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.\nPerhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.\nI remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices.

I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.\nAt least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b196,tt0112573,Braveheart,davidmvining,23 December 2023,10,"Mel Gibson's second directed feature is a big, brash effort at mythologization of a historical figure that is a sweeping entertainment that gets all of the narrative details right while leaving the actual history a complete mess. I don't care, this is such a wonderful entertainment that its large detours from actual history simply don't bother me. Did Randall Wallace, the screenwriter, and Gibson know that the Battle of Stirling Bridge involved a bridge? You betcha. Did it matter to this mythmaking adventure? Nope, so they dropped it. What about the whole thing about the Princess of Wales actually just being a child in France at the time? Well, you don't get the grand romance of the second half without her, so in she goes, all adult and pretty. It's largely ahistorical nonsense in the details (getting the 30,000 foot few of the events largely correct), but the entertainment is the point. And the entertainment is good.\nThe story of the First Scottish War for Independence begins with Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) and his brutal efforts to tamp down on Scottish sentiment against English rule by killing the men willing to fight, including the father of William Wallace (Gibson) who goes off to learn the world with his uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), returning as a young adult (Gibson doesn't look much like a young adult, to be honest) to raise a farm and a family. His childhood friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson) is happy to challenge him to feats of strength at the wedding that Wallace wanders into, all while Wallace catches the eye of Murron (Catherine McCormack). There's a quick romance, they marry in secret to save them from sending her to the local lord for his sexual rights through prima nocta (ahistorical, but whatever), and she is murdered by the local magistrate when an English soldier tries to rape her, Wallace defends her, and she gets captured to lure him out.\nSo begins the rabble-rousing inception to the rebellion against the English presence in Scotland, a mixture of personal and ideological reasons that led him into a fight that was brimming across the country for a while that Wallace sparked. That the personal reason is intimately tied into the ideological one around the ""rape, theft, and murder"" of England against Scotland that matches what happened to Wallace through Murron. It's the basic narrative storytelling that Gibson showed strong grasping of throughout his career, up through Apocalypto and Hacksaw Ridge. The opening half hour of romance flows naturally through to the rest of the film filled with battles.\nThe battles get going after some expert setup of the situation as we watch Longshanks deal with his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) and his daughter-in-law Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) while Wallace is introduced to Scottish politics through mainly Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) whose father (Ian Brennan), is scheming on every side of every event, working towards Robert becoming king of Scotland. The nobles are constantly trying to get out of fights to negotiate for to increase their own lands. It's Wallace who comes into the situation, injecting it with a healthy dose of populist appeal for freedom (a gauzy use of the word that is more explicitly about Scotland being ruled by Scots...the same Scot lords that are constantly trying to sell out their people but more implicitly the Lockean ideal of personal liberty) that gets the people behind the revolt.\nAnd the battles are grandly staged. Before CGI gave us CGI armies, Mel Gibson dressed a few hundred people up in different uniforms and threw them at each other before going down the Chimes at Midnight route of capturing small snippets of battle to imply larger action through editing. The battles don't match to reality all that much (Stirling is missing the bridge, and the fire stuff at Falkirk is borderline nonsense), but they're incredibly well-filmed, staged, and they serve their narrative purposes very well. Stirling is Wallace's rise, and Falkirk is Wallace's fall, and it all comes together rather perfectly.\nThe mythologization of Wallace has to include his martyrdom for the cause which, thankfully, has some basis in the reality of how Wallace actually died. I think it could have pushed the reality a bit further since Wallace ended up being one of the only prominent Scots who, after a series of battles leading to English dominance, refused to mark allegiance to the English crown, making him a particular object of hate for Longshanks. Instead, the film has him go on a course of vengeance against the Scottish nobles that betrayed him on the Falkirk battlefield, never quite getting far up enough in the chain to get to Robert the Bruce who convinces him to come in for talks, leading to his ultimate capture.\nIt's really amazing how well all of this works and comes together, and a lot of that has to do with the actors. Gibson is a strong actor who became one of the biggest movie stars in the world, and he directs himself reasonably well, maintaining his accent strongly. He is a rootable underdog who has solid reasons for fighting his unwinnable fight, and Gibson is largely working on his charm. The rest of the cast is very good. Gibson is a very good actors' director, and he brings out great stuff from everyone involved from Marceau's woundedness and vulnerability turning into a veiled strength to Gleeson's bravado mixed with his earnest concern for Wallace's safety to David O'Hara as Stephen the Irishman and his mixture of being touched by God and vulgar and concerned as well. It's a very strong ensemble cast in support of Gibson's central character that helps fill out the edges of the action with detailed performances and adding to the overall verisimilitude.\nGibson made a triumph of a film. A rousing entertainment that brought David Lean scale up to the 90s sensibilities filled with wonderful performances, well-filmed with a strong eye towards composition, and told on an epic scale. I think I might have been a bit torn about whether to vote for this or Apollo 13 for the Best Picture Oscar had I been a voter at the time, but Braveheart winning doesn't feel like any kind of steal. It feels earned.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

Catherine McCormack stood out with her pure beauty. Returning to his village years later, William Wallace marries his childhood sweetheart and begins to live a quiet life. When the English killed his wife, the fire of rebellion started by Wallace, who was burning with revenge, spread throughout Scotland and turned into a war of freedom against Edward Long-Legged.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b199,tt0112573,Braveheart,Lejink,9 November 2023,8,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.\nWe follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.\nFor those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible nobility, in particular the treachery of the future Scottish hero - King, Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.\nCertainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,

The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom.\nDirected by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull).\nEvery aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film.\nIn conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love.

Cinematography captures the stunning Scottish landscapes and the brutality of battle with precision. Gibson's directing is ambitious, successfully weaving together action, drama, and historical context. The writing creates a powerful narrative, though it takes some liberties with history.

Instead of building up the mousquetaire characters and team spirit we have 4 loose swords competing for screen time and waiting for their cue to mouth one-liners.\nThe other creative choices are defensible and a chunk of passable acting can certainly be traced down to bad direction. I am convinced nobody in the industry will overvalue the achievement of daddies boys (producer and director) so wildly missing the mark, but it is always puzzling to see a part of the audience just gobbling up fine images as a fine movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

However, instead he helps them in a fight of their own and becomes their firm friend, falls in love and becomes embroiled in an adventure to stop the evil Cardinal Richelieu growing his power base at court, starting with a betrayal of the queen.\nGiven that the story is French, it is a bit strange that there hasn't been a French version for over 60 years, but enjoyably this has put that right. We are rather used to our Three Musketeer stories being rather light hearted pieces of derring do and usually bordering on straight comedy eg the glorious Richard Lester versions from the seventies. This version - part 2 is to follow - is far more serious and rather more determined to stay loyal to the book and its tone. It is noticeably more serious and darker than previous adaptations, albeit flecked with bits of humour, but this shouldn't put you off. There is of course a strong story here which here has yielded many exciting and well staged set pieces set amongst some glorious French backdrops.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1a2,tt12672536,Les trois mousquetaires: D'Artagnan,DeanAmythe,29 November 2023,3,"The type of film someone who sees one every 5 months will say was pretty good and then forget about in an hour. Most of this isn't even what I'd consider bad per say, but all of it is executed in an exceedingly dull manner, except I guess the fight scenes which are presented in long shots, but even those suffer from obnoxious handheld: they do this weird thing where the camera moves in synchronization with the blades, which I presume is supposed to accentuate each move, but ends up completely muddling the visibility.\nSo this ends up feeling like one of those TV productions with a half decent budget supporting it: it clearly isn't cheap but it does look the part. A complete bore of a visual palette - either orange-brown or the most flat looking blue you've ever seen - and nothing cinematographically of note. Conversations are shot / reverse shot with shallow focus (you know the kind) and a lot of scenes were clearly shot with the intention of getting a ton of coverage and hoping to get something out of it in the edit.\nI usually don't delve into the audio part of things, but I just want to mention that this unapologetically copy-pasted Hans Zimmer's Batman theme (it's literally the ""can I copy your homework"" meme) and for some reason used a Wilhelm scream on a bird?? If someone put it there as a joke in secret, I applaud you for creating the best moment in this film.\nThe bar for that is as low as can be, though. Talking about a film like this, as much as my review here may prove otherwise, is difficult as it falls in the most boring category: utterly mediocre.

To simply put, the production is top notch. Be with the setting and the costumes, the era is set solidly and the director wastes no time in kickstarting with the action right from the introduction scene of D'Artagnan.

It is an excellent film in many technical aspects with a wonderful production. It has a good cast and the script offers a much more detailed plot of The Three Musketeers. Athos accused of a crime he did not commit, the hidden romance between Buckingham and Anne, the Protestants, historical elements of the conflict between France and England and a clue about Milady's past are details that greatly help the dynamics of the plot. It is a classic action and adventure story very well executed and adapted to current times. Like the first adaptations, this film only narrates half of the novel and does so in a spectacular way. Les Trois Mousquetaires: D'Artagnan is perhaps the definitive adaptation of Dumas' work and leaves a very good impression with desire to see the rest of the story in the second part.

Perhaps I should say, ""Je viens de regarder le film"" but I think I'll write this review for an anglophone audience. There may be a version with English subtitles but the one I watched did not have that option. I had to pause and listen again a few times, but the dialogue is generally not too hard to follow if your French is not too rusty.\nFor purists, it may be a disappointment, but for me it was a delight. The film was not exactly faithful to the original story by Alexandre Dumas, although overall it followed the same trajectory. For example, when Athos told the story of his wife to D'Artagnan, they were not drunk and sprawled across a table at an inn, but in the forest where Athos had just mocked D'Artagnan with a bit of friendly swordplay. Also, D'Artagnan was buried alive in the original story, but he was in a coffin and it was Athos who dug him out of the ground. In this film he dug himself out of an open-pit grave coughing and wheezing.\nD'Artagnan's letter of introduction to M. De Tréville from his father was particularly annoying. An important part of the story was that it was in his doublet when it was stolen in Meung.\nAlso, where were Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton, and Planchet? They figured large in the original story, but weren't even a footnote in the film.\nBut the introduction of D'Artagnan to the trio was perfectly faithful to the original, and delightfully amusing. Within an hour of his arrival in Paris, D'Artagnan had managed to rile Athos, Porthos, and Aramis and he had agreed to fight them in duels, one after the other. He paid his rent four weeks in advance (4 livres) ""au cas où."" The humor was morbid, dry, and subtle, and I think it was faithful to the description by Dumas.\nThe actors chosen for the parts represented interesting choices. Porthos was not as portly as he should have been, in my mind, nor Athos as taciturn, nor Aramis as refined and beautiful, nor Richelieu as commanding. And none of them had particularly long hair (except for Athos before they cut it in anticipation of slicing through his neck.) Moreover, the actors portraying the mousquetaires were all a bit long in the tooth.\nStill, after a bit it all came together with credible performances. I'm not very familiar with French actors, but the actors in this film all carried their characters brilliantly. (Ils ont crevé l'écran, as the French say. They ""crushed"" it.) The actress chosen for Constance Bonacieux was perfect. She was charming and pretty and young, but not beautiful or refined, just as Dumas painstakingly described her in the book.\nHowever, it was jarring was when Constance was stitching the wound of D'Artagnan and she said something like ""Quelques centimètres"" meaning that it was lucky the shot wasn't just a bit to the left. But anything set in that period would have used ""puces"" (inches) and ""pieds"" (feet). To be sure, the French got so upset with the clergy and the nobility that they changed the names of the months of the year, the days of the week, the units of measurement, and the position of the head relative to the shoulders of 17 thousand aristocrats, but that wouldn't happen till 165 years after this story was set. (Would be interesting to see if, in the versions subtitled in English, the translation given was ""a few inches to the left"". I know they often use different units in translations meant for US consumption. Pounds, miles, etc.)\nI really appreciated it when the king said, near the end, ""Messieurs, voici les fameux trois mousquetaires, qui sont désormais quatre"" (or something like that), even though it wasn't in the book. The complete lack of political correctness was refreshing as well. If he had said ""mesdames et messieurs..."" it would have lacked historical authenticity.\nThe fighting scenes were particularly stunning. There was plenty of violence and blood, just as in the novel, and the réalisateur chose to go with that quirky NYPD Blue-style camera angle, which I think gave it a gritty reality often missing from films set in the early 17th century. Combatants in close quarters do not have a drone's-eye view, and this is reflected in scenes of more recent battles (e.g., Thin Red Line). It was refreshing to see that treatment in a depiction of more ancient battles.\nThe locations were real, or so it seemed. The white cliffs of Dover are hard to simulate, and the château de Vincennes is probably also hard to replicate. I'd guess that all the places were filmed in situ.\nOverall I can recommend it to--well, I'm going to borrow a Spanish word here because we don't have this one in English (nor, as far as I know, in French)--to aficionados of Les Trois Mousquetaires. Just keep an open mind regarding the small details, which will be different from the book.\nNote that this film corresponds to Tome I of Les Trois Mousquetaires, roughly the first 30 chapters. Hopefully they'll make sequel. That was hinted after the credits with a small ""à suivre"" teaser featuring Milady and le Cardinal Richelieu in which she referenced ""les mousquetaires"".\nFor those who have not recently read the book and who might want to reference it, The Gutenberg Project has several versions in its excellent and free collection.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

I mention them as the central characters versus the main protagonists as they are supported by no less than Taylor Swift, Robert De Nero, Zoe Saldana, Robbie Malek, Mike Myers and more.\nAt the end I was left thinking I have seen a beautifully filmed, exceptionally well acted, well told story (which was apparently mostly true). Sure it is not going to be for everyone but if you are a fan of cinema, of wonderful acting, of a good plot, put aside a couple of hours and try this film and bask in Christian Bale being Columbo (deliberate or not)",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

There's literally nothing original, interesting or even vaguely suspense driven about it.\nIt has a gentle tone about it, which prevents it from infusing an infuriating feeling of wasting one's time, but it is 99% exactly like 1990s pop-jazz elevator music.\nBut it is aggravating, because there is obviously even talent and money involved for it to be really good.\nWho is writing this crap!?\nIt reeks of nepotism and young-Millenial-meets Gen-z's elites who seem Yo have zero grit/absolutely no first hand life experience amd are completely unwilling to venture out of the ever closing-in-walls of what's 'socially acceptable'.\nThe blame for this utter waste of money and time most likely falls on every executive and hands on producers involved, but not off the hook are the writers and directors, and even actors who choose to be involved.\nBut essentially, the blame is on the financial backers, be gigantic corporations like Amazon, or a mix of highly propaganda oriented media companies.\nSadly, the result is the same - utterly boring story telling.\nLet's just hope that this dark age of fiction media story telling doesn't last too much longer.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1af,tt10304142,Amsterdam,I_Ailurophile,14 December 2023,5,"The all-star cast rivals the ever-growing ensembles of Wes Anderson, and all involved give terrific performances full of spirit and personality. Filmmaker David O. Russell has made some noteworthy, well regarded films. Everyone behind the scenes turned in outstanding work across the board: sharp costume design, impeccable hair and makeup, crisp cinematography and editing, excellent stunts and effects, rich art direction, fine props, and so on and so on. The dialogue is witty, the characters are weird, the scene writing is wacky, and the story is, in turn, well-written, wild, wise, and/or worldly. And unfortunately, none of it impresses nearly as much as it's supposed to. 'Amsterdam' is very well made, there are some cutting ideas in the plot, and this even earns some laughs, but far more than not these 134 minutes come off as little more than a lot of hot air.\nFrom the moment it begins there's an overwhelming sense of falseness to the proceedings; this sense will not change, and it will come to pervade most every facet of the production. Every time one of the many, many big-name stars comes into a scene, and especially when they appear for the first time, they are framed, or the camera zooms in on them, in a manner that's meant to pointlessly accentuate their celebrity (e.g., ""Hey! Look who it is!""). Under Russell's guidance the cinematography is also, generally, often tawdrily grandiose, such as when the camera sweeps up from a low angle to look at Margot Robbie - not because the moment is dramatic, but specifically just because the inclusion is meant to wow us. For as unquestionably superb as the acting is, and for all the cleverness of the writing, far too much of that cleverness, and the actors' animated portrayals, come off in context as empty quirkiness and boisterousness for its own sake (e.g., ""Hey! Look how silly this is!""). It also takes the better part of one hour for the picture to feel like it's finding its feet, yet at the same time, the narrative and scene writing result in plot development that's a tad sideways, caring about that Gee Golly quirkiness as much as the story on hand.\nEven the production values, meeting the highest standards of live-action cinema in the 2020s, are actually kind of a problem; the utmost vividness of the image quality, and of every little detail, is a little too perfect. Speaking of ""a little too perfect,"" the even tone and level-headed verbiage of Christian Bale's narration serves to flatten the vibrancy the feature should carry; consider a preteen child telling a scary story with the undeveloped, matter-of-fact, Just So storytelling sensibility of ""This happened. And then this happened. Next, this happened."" Much of the plot draws from notions that are all too real - the collusion of capitalist interests, the wealthy and powerful, and those with significant ties in society or government and/or the military; conspiracies to dominate, subjugate, oppress, and install fascist leaders; manipulation, gaslighting, propaganda, and the weaponization of medicine - and urgent, admirable themes of diversity, acceptance of minorities and the marginalized, justice, equality, the pursuit of truth, actively fighting authoritarians, and more. All of this was relevant to the period in question, and remains despairingly, desperately relevant in 2023. Yet too much else about 'Amsterdam' either countermands that substance, or treats it too lightly, or distracts from it: that Gee Golly quirkiness, the most raucous sequences, the utmost perfection of most elements; the most whimsical aspects of the art direction, the exceptional performances that under Russell's direction threaten to become their own story rather than to serve the one being told, the prevailing light tenor; the pointed repetition of key words or phrases (""Amsterdam,"" ""Committee of Five"") like they were the Word of the Day in an episode of 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse'; and more.\nEverything looks and sounds great in and of itself. I'm a big fan of many of the cast members, and from one to the next I don't know whose performance is stronger. Between Russell's writing and direction, however, the impression that 'Amsterdam' makes is of a movie that wants to emphasize how smart it is, and how well made it is, and how many stars it has, and just how ridiculous its most ridiculous parts are - rather than how important, meaningful, and worthy the narrative is. This title is so self-important that it wants to point to all its ""Gee whiz!"" factors as its attractants and its strength rather than the earnest substance it has to offer, or the earnest hard work that everyone put into it. We know that Russell can be a great filmmaker. While I haven't watched it in some time, I fell in love with 'I heart Huckabees' from the first time I saw it. Sadly, despite all that it serves up and all that it could and should have been, this 2022 flick just doesn't make the grade, and I think that comes back entirely to Russell. The cast and crew deserved a better film; this should have been that better film. I don't abjectly dislike it, but it feels like no more than half of a whole, and the half that's missing includes the heart and integrity. I'm glad for those who appreciate 'Amsterdam' more than I do, but as far as I'm concerned it's no wonder that this came and went last year with so little fanfare. Better luck next time, everyone.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

I wanted to love it, but it left me completely cold. Line deliveries were stilted, strange, and downright unnatural at times. Dialogue was dull, bizarre, or repetitious throughout. Very little chemistry between characters, and the comedy never landed for me. It often felt like characters were talking at each other, instead of to each other. The editing was choppy, the cinematography uninspired or distracting in turns. It's got a good message, and some OK story ideas, but they are ham-handedly delivered and often completely jumbled.

The chemistry between Bale, Margot Robbie, and John David Washington is off the charts. DeNiro and Mike Myers are at their best too, as is everyone in the brilliant cast. The screenplay is the best of Russell's career.\nThe movie looks back at the Nazis and the ultra-rich businessmen who tried to change history for the worse in the 1930s. It looks forward to the very same kinds of people who have risen again in the 2020s. The underlying theme is the struggle to save democracy.\nAt the same time the film is frequently hilarious. It's romantic and beautiful too, and toward the end suspenseful. Try to imagine a mixture of Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and Alfred Hitchcock.\nAmsterdam was a financial flop when it appeared, perhaps because it appeared at an early post-pandemic moment when reviewers and audiences shied away from anything even remotely challenging.

Roosevelt to replace him with Major General Smedley Butler. The film was both written and directed by David O. Russell.\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nThe talented cast is almost endless and includes Hollywood A-listers and 3 Oscar winners, as well as 2 Oscar nominees ike Robert De Niro, Christian Bale, Rami Malek, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Chris Rock, Anya Taylor-Joy, Zoe Saldana, Mike Myers, Michael Shannon, Timothy Olyphant, Andrea Riseborough, and even music icon Taylor Swift!\nI didn't expect so much singing! Nice! Does anyone know if those actors were actually singing or dubbed?\nIt's fun to see comedian Chris Rock in this movie. Rumor has it that Christian Bale refused to talk to him because Christian was so worried Chris would make him laugh on set. Christian Bale was one of the producers of the film. In fact, the entire cast seemed to be having a ball. Watching actors enjoy their roles always makes it more enjoyable for audiences. The cast was so excited about working with the director and each other that they all lowered their regular fees.\nThe set designs and costumes easily set a believable tone for the period. Everything LOOKED great, including all of the actors. It's the telling of the story itself that prevented the movie from becoming a charming hit. Instead, it's expected to lose $97 million worldwide.\nTrying to solve the whodunnit mystery is a fun element of the film, although most viewers won't care about the answer.\nIt's said that it cost $80 million to make this movie, partly because the sets had already been built in Boston but, due to the pandemic, the location had to be changed to Los Angeles.\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nUnfortunately, the script didn't measure up to the vast talent of the cast. It's a matter of expectations not being met that has left most viewers deflated. When we see the impressive cast list, we naturally assume the movie is going to be great.\nI've been to Amsterdam twice now. It's a beautiful city. I wish the movie had more street scenes to really get the vibe of the city. We don't even see any of the famous canals in the movie.\nIt's weird that even with so much star power, I was bored many times and couldn't wait for it to end.\nThe plot is convoluted and overstuffed. The movie felt like a patchwork quilt, stitched together with loose threads and random pieces of beautiful fabric. The parts were definitely better than the sum in this disappointing movie. It seems to be the victim of 14 different scripts that were worked on during the production.\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:\nWe see a dead body being dissected in an autopsy\nWe see bloodied soldiers riddled with bullets that must be removed.\nTo see my full review, go to my Youtube channel called Movie Review Mom!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b48,,,,,

But the biggest problem I found was this type of 'disguise' of the perpetrator really narrowed down the potential identity possibilities (with out giving away too much, it's fairly obvious there are only a couple of realistic options).\nBut anyway, it's a fun and enjoyable movie, and something different for this year so not a bad attempt overall.

This film is a complete departure from the OG trailer in tone and style. We thought about seeing this in the theater, and I'm so glad I didn't waste $20 but p!rated it later instead.\nSome moments feel jarring and out of place because establishing shots/scenes are missing. Filming basics 101: you have a setup, then a payoff. But the setup is missing over and over so the payoffs have no weight to them. The deaths happen too fast and then the film just moves on. The trampoline scene is just thrown in, but the trailer version was better. There was never any moment where the killer was in trouble or about to get caught. Whether a victim escaped the killer or not didn't matter to me because there wasn't much characterization leading up to the chases. So it's like, who cares?\nThe gore was tasteless and frankly, MPAA should've slapped an NC-17 rating on this. Specifically the scene where he smashes a guy's head open with a meat mallet. The dumpster scene was ridiculous too, both in gore and just the physics didn't make sense.\nIn the parade scene, the killer isn't dressed like a pilgrim anymore, but as a clown. I guess to surprise us? I appreciated the few brief humor moments. Movies like this shouldn't take themselves too seriously. Despite the funny moments, the extreme violence and depraved nature of the killings ruined the vibe. I liked the actors even if their Mass accents were over the top.

He's smitten with his coworker Kate (Phoebe Cates) who also works at nights at the local bar, and he's at the mercy of Gerald (Judge Reinhold) at the bank as well as the wealthiest woman in town, Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday), who is a mix between the Wicked Witch of the West and Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life (a film we see on screen more than once).\nThings go wrong, of course, when Randal gives Billy the creature named Gizmo, and he starts breaking the three rules. He can keep Gizmo out of the sunlight pretty easily, but his young friend Pete (Corey Feldman) accidentally gets Gizmo wet, spawning five more little Mogwai. Billy takes one to the high school science teacher Mr. Hanson (Glynn Turman) who takes a blood sample for...reasons. But this all leads to both sets of Mogwai to getting their handlers to break the third rule, not to feed them after midnight, turning them from Mogwai to the titular gremlins.\nThis is where the heart of the film is: Dante's combination of his love of 50s science fiction schlock with fun toys on screen with the Gremlins causing havoc wherever they go, first in the Peltzer kitchen where Randal's gadgets fill the place, giving the perfect place for Lynn (Frances Lee McCain), Billy's mom, putting one of them in a blender to wonderfully gruesome effect.\nThe final half of the movie is just an escalating series of chaos as the Gremlins get beaten back, come back in heavily increased numbers, and just run amok all over Kingston Falls. The centerpiece really is the scene in the bar, a technical display of different puppets doing a wide assortment of Looney Tunes-inspired antics that really just gets lost in the puppetry and gags but is the most entertaining the movie gets.\nThat's because the actual story is perfectly competently assembled by Columbus in the script and presented by Dante, but it's never really more than competent. It doesn't help that little subplots just kind of disappear like Judge Reinhold's character just not appearing in the film after about the third way mark even though he was obviously built to pay off with some kind of comeuppance in the final act. Billy doesn't really have much of an arc, which isn't a requirement in fiction (look at Marty McFly in Back to the Future), but he also doesn't have much of a goal other than survive the crazy night. Heck, it's not even really a goal to go out with Kate. He convinces her to go on a date with him before the chaos erupts. At least the chaos includes a fun ending for Mrs. Deagle, though.\nWhat drives the film is the technical side of things and the comedy, mostly stemming from the work of Dick Miller as a down and out schlub with Dante giving him room to just be himself.\nIt all balances out to an entertaining little film somewhat in the style of Spielberg but undoubtedly Dante's with Dante wearing his influences on his sleeve. It's one of the things I like most about his movies, manifesting in this with the playing of It's a Wonderful Life to the presence of the Looney Tunes stuffed animals in the store late, Dante isn't afraid of paying explicit tribute to the movies and short films that he loved. It gives his films a young kid kind of energy that makes them surprisingly infectious, even if the actual narratives end up somewhat lackluster.\nGremlins is a fun little 80s timepiece, Joe Dante's first effort to prove himself on a decently large scale, evidence that Spielberg had an eye for young talent, and an entertaining technical achievement. It really could have used another draft to both cut out some early stuff that got left on the cutting room floor in the edit and to give Billy something more of a specific goal to achieve through the chaos. Either that, or just lean far more into the chaos. Maybe the sequel will choose one of those two directions.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1c0,tt0087363,Gremlins,elicopperman,8 December 2023,9,"In 1984, one of the most insane horror comedies was released by Steven Spielberg entitled Gremlins. Directed by cult filmmaker Joe Dante, the film was a huge hit with critics and audiences and is often regarded as one of the greatest horror comedies of the last 50 years. While it did gain infamy for its grotesque violence, which resulted in the PG-13 rating, it is still cherished to this day and spawned a sequel a few years later and a recent animated series on Max. As far as how the film holds up nowadays, it's probably one of the darkest comedies that works in what it set out to do thanks to its cartoony nature.\nThe film follows a young man named Billy Peltzer who receives a strange creature from his father called a mogwai. When the mogwai spawns other creatures, they end up becoming small destructive monsters that all wreak havoc on Billy's town during Christmas Eve. At its core, Gremlins may seem like a cautionary allegory on consumerism, especially when the mogwai creatures are not to be handled by the ignorant American public. That being said, the film knows how to treat the mogwai as a proper pet in the form of Gizmo, who Billy looks after with certain restrictions like no bright lights or feeding after midnight. Once the other gremlins kick in however, that's when the film unleashes its cartoony slapstick and brutal violence on display. As gruesome and horrifying as the film may be, Dante knows to keep the balance between supernaturally scary and nonsensically humorous, so we are left laughing at the mayhem caused by the manic Gremlins as much as we are in horror of it all. There are very few films that have managed this blending of the genres as funnily as this one.\nIn addition to Billy making for a charming lead in reacting to all the insanity, his girlfriend Kate Beringer is an added bonus to the film's sweet center. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates share cute chemistry with each other in lieu of all the frights, and it's easy to see them trying to make end's meet in a small town corrupted by the antagonistic miser Mrs. Deagle. While some characters don't leave as much of an impression as they could like Billy's condescending coworker Gerald Hopkins or Billy's inventor father, others like Billy's concerned mother, the cranky Murray Futterman, the experimenting science teacher Mr. Hanson or little Pete Fountaine all contribute some damage to the monsters or get the short end of the stick from them in different forms of comeuppance. Also, on top of a lot of crazy vocal effects for the gremlin creatures, Howie Mandel steals the show as Gizmo and can make even a small whistle or cry from the guy sound adorably heart wrenching. Add on a cunning performance from Frank Welker as the rebellious leader Stripe and you got one heck of a vocal cast.\nNow in regards to the phenomenal special effects work done on the gremlins, Chris Walas and team managed to blend cute and creepy in such a versatile manner. When one puts into consideration just how complicated the mechanics and puppetry was to pull off, it makes the film all the more spectacular just to see all the crazy stunts and pratfalls the gremlin creatures get to pull off. In many ways, the gremlins are more cartoony than any other depiction of the creatures in cartoons prior like Falling Hare or Russian Rhapsody, since the havoc wreaking chaos they ensue paints them as rambunctious teenagers going against society rather than merely strange creatures coming out of nowhere. Jerry Goldsmith's score conveys the dark humor and nonstop suspense flawlessly and John Hora's cinematography adds into the thrill of seeing strange creatures scramble from the shadows in lieu of the holiday season. Considering the influence of the Warner Bros cartoons at play, it's no wonder Dante and his crew took the chance to unleash their inner mania through the art of B-movie tributes.\nBy blending horror and comedy with enough heart, frights and laughter all in 100 minutes, Gremlins holds up wonderfully as a modern Christmas classic. If you haven't seen this film before, you're curious about more of Dante's work or you're an overall sucker for wacky horror comedies, then this film is right up your alley. Now that the film is approaching its 40 year anniversary quite soon, there couldn't be a better time to check it out than this very moment. After all, you never know when something innocent could turn into something dangerous if one doesn't take their well being into consideration.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

Remember the rules !. You didn't listen !. Don't get him wet, keep him out of bright light, and never feed him after midnight. They didn't obey the rules. We're Back!\nDirector Joe Dante presents a quite good and violent but far more campy vision, paying myriad surreal tribute to movies as well as soundtracks with great sense of amusement. Hijinks ensue as a mild-mannered bank teller releases these hideous loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules: No water (violated), no food after midnight (violated), and no bright light. Naturally, there're lots of mayhem , frolics , antics and jokes , this all happening at the town and the result is a gang of nasty gremlins who decide to tear up the houses and cinemas. This watchable enough motion picture was professionally directed by Joe Dante displaying their characteristic surrealist humor and sense of style . The story is nothing more than an amusing excuse to string together gags , silly sketches , ironical craziness , several cameos and fast-paced set pieces. Dante is surely right to let his visual imagination run along with likeable comedy, irony and great inventive. Including ¨Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs¨ and other famous film parodies and other musical extravaganzas of the past. Also incorporates satire , takes on TV news and funny action, adding a lot of rapid-fire surreal sight gags. Along with ordinary starring : Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, appearing here and there a number of familiar secondaries and various cameos, such as : Polly Holliday, Belinda Balaski, Keye Luke, Frances Lee McCain, Dick Miller, Edward Andrews, Judge Reinhold, Chuck Jones, William Schallert, Harry Carey Jr, Scott Brady, Steven Spielberg, Kenneth Tobey Nicky Katt, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks .And musician Jerry Goldsmish who composes a lively and enjoyable score. Followed by a sequel ¨Gremlins II¨, it's inferior to original, set in a futuristic skyscraper in the Big Apple where the young couple: Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates of now work for the money-grubbing tech-mogul John Glover, co-starred by Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky , Robert Picardo, Haviland Morris , Dick Miller , Raymond Cruz , Julia Sweeney , Keye Luke, Kathleen Freeman\nLavishly Produced by Steven Spielberg , and professionally directed by Joe Dante, with originality enough. Dante's most hits took place when found himself working alongside Steven Spielberg, John Landis and Australian director George Miller for the anthology movie ¨The Twilight Zone, The Movie¨ (1983) in which Dante directed the third segment . Steven Spielberg then hired him to work as director for ¨Gremlins¨ (1984) which was another box-office success. He directed some episodes for the Sci-Fi series ""Amazing Stories"" before directing his next Science Fiction feature which was ¨Innerspace¨ (1987) which, whilst critically well reviewed, was another box office failure. After directing five episodes of ""Eerie, Indiana"", Dante returned to the big-screen with the well-received ¨Matinee¨ (1993), an affectionate period satire set in 1962 against the background of the Cold War. Dante spent the next several years working for television and directed a satire on politics with ¨The Second Civil War¨ (1997) . Dante's next two films, ¨Small Soldiers¨ (1998), and ¨Looney Toons: Back in Action¨ (2004) garnered good reviews but were not commercial hits. Gremlins rating : 7/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

While there he happens to notice a strange little animal that he had never seen before and, upon inquiring about it, is told that it is called a mogwai. Noticing how cute and friendly it appears to be, Randall offers to buy it but is told it isn't for sale. Somewhat discouraged, he leaves the store but is approached by the old man's ""Grandson"" (John Louie) who secretly hands the mogwai to him in exchange for the money Randall offered earlier. After eagerly accepting the deal, Randall is then informed of 3 basic rules for taking care of the mogwai--with the main rule being to never feed it after midnight. After acknowledging these 3 basic rules, Randle quickly hurries back home where he presents it to his teenage son ""Billy Peltzer"" (Zach Galligan) as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, not long afterward, Billy accidentally feeds it after midnight--and extreme chaos starts from that point on. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I remember being quite entertained by this movie when it first came out and, having now watched it again, I must say that it still retains most of its earlier charm.

Directed by Joe Dante and produced by Steven Spielberg, the movie offers a unique and entertaining experience that has delighted audiences for decades.\nThe film centers on a young man named Billy Peltzer, played by Zach Galligan, who receives an unusual but adorable pet called a Mogwai, named Gizmo, as a Christmas gift. However, as the film's iconic rules dictate, the adorable Mogwai should never be exposed to bright light, water, or fed after midnight. Of course, these rules are promptly broken, leading to the chaos that ensues.\nWhat sets ""Gremlins"" apart is its ability to masterfully balance horror and humor. The mischievous little Gremlins, born from Gizmo's transformation, are both sinister and comical. The film's practical effects and puppetry bring these creatures to life in a way that feels tangible and adds to the charm of the movie.\nPhoebe Cates delivers a standout performance as Kate, Billy's love interest, providing depth and a touch of darkness to the film through her character's memorable monologue about her aversion to Christmas.

The film mirrors this ambition as characters embark on a quest to shoot a high-class porno, setting the stage for an unconventional yet intriguing experience.\nWest succeeds in delivering more than your typical titillating slasher. Character development takes the spotlight, providing a depth rarely found in the genre. As the plot unfolds, it becomes evident that West is not interested in taming the horror; he aims to send shivers down your spine with graphic kills that punctuate the narrative.\nThe performances across the board are nothing short of excellent, capturing the essence of the 1979 setting. Mia Goth shoulders the lion's share of the work, while Brittany Snow proves to be very effective. Kid Cudi, in a surprising turn, delivers an excellent performance that adds to the film's overall charm.\nHowever, the film misses an opportunity to explore a potentially compelling connection between Maxine and Pearl, two characters whose untapped dynamic could have elevated the narrative even further.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1cb,tt13560574,X,fernandoschiavi,19 December 2023,7,"In his newest film, ""X', Tie West ventures into the slasher category, using as a reference the cinema of the revolutionary and subversive Tobe Hooper. More precisely, West focused on Hopper's first two films that received commercial appeal, namely "" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)"" and ""Devoured Alive (1976)"". Considered the pioneer of the slasher before ""Halloween"", the film that immortalized the figure of Leatherface is a unique piece in the history of cinema, and although not told a true story, as was announced at the time of its release, it had a categorical particularity in presenting a premise so terrifying and disturbing that it seemed to be a real record at times, about a brief trip between friends that had a brutal and suffocating outcome Following the shocking sick representation of human perversity, ""Devour Alive"" featured another ghastly plot in which an old owner of a roadside hotel killed potential guests and served them as food for his pet crocodile.\nKnowing the many interpretations of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the American cultural context, its impact as a landmark of visual change for horror, language, and also as a precursor to the generic elements that characterized the subgenre, Ti West arrived in his slasher subversive ""X"", which points a lot of inspiration to those who strongly influenced the niche, which also includes nods to ""Psycho (1960)"" by Alfred Hitchcock (as well as ""Eaten Alive"" composed), but still, manages to deliver a result clayey and authentic. In the wake that paved the way for an impressive recognition of Hooper's classic, it was the same one that also promoted controversial discussions for an archetype condemned in the film with regard to female representation. If the final girl originated from there, it was possible to observe a contradiction behind the image of the final girl, because she received that name after having all the misfortune and violence prolonged longer than other characters, and in the end, surviving. In this discursive liner, West focuses his story to talk about the search for female independence, the escape from the role played by patriarchy through Maxine (Mia Goth), the protagonist who aims for her emancipation and success as a porn film star. The year is 1978, and here we follow a group of young adults in the race to shake up the porn industry with a feature film with a more elaborate and authorial language than what productions used to deliver at the time.\n""X"" is divided into two parts with very different tones. In the first, by the way, the best of them, there is the construction of a great atmosphere of expectation. In the midst of preparing the ground for a carnage announced from the first scene - basically, the entire plot is one big flashback -, Ti West displays several signs of intertextuality, that is, how much he will drink from the fertile sources of his reference. One of them is Psycho (1960), a film by Alfred Hitchcock cited as one of the favorites of the director's character with artistic ambitions, one who is committed to making ""quality porn"". Later on, when the killing begins, the appearance of the car partially submerged in the lake is a creative way of diversifying the nod to good old Hitchcock's masterpiece, now with something from the film manifesting itself in the narrative fabric. Therefore, intertextuality has distinct layers and ways of being. Another of them is the reappropriation of a slasher commonplace: sexual rage as an indication of who is going to die. Even the two characters who don't have sex end up dying brutally. But what changes here is the motivation of the villains. Out comes the pure juice of abstract redneck moralism and in comes sexual repression enhanced by the messianic discourse of religious people who contribute to this repression. The script signed by West points out that this violence has a source.\nThe second part of ""X"" is the massacre itself. But, before talking about it, it is good to consider the curious figure of murderous hosts. Pearl (Mia Goth) and Howard (Stephen Ure) are isolated people, emotionally trapped in a distant time of glory. However, beyond this aspect that helps to contextualize the murderous rage, there is an aesthetic choice by Ti West: the clearly fake makeup that transforms two relatively young actors into cachectic elderly people. This choice is part of an apparently deliberate movement towards the artificial, a wink at the audience regarding the purely cinematic nature of what they are watching - there are many other moments in which the plot asks us to turn off disbelief and adhere to artifice. When the old men take action, the story plunges into a spiral of more or less predictable brutal deaths until only the final girl remains - a famous narrative trope in horror productions, the survivor who faces the evildoers last and who (usually) is left to tell the story. Therefore, adherence to models established by other films takes place within a new layer of intertextuality, with tradition serving as a source of nourishment and emotional inspiration. As for slave deaths, it is therefore not a question of ""if"" they will happen, but of ""when"" and ""how"".\nWest's filmic structure, which is configured by the slow way in which the narrative is conducted, valuing how language can tell a story, gains points in the way in which the premise unfolds, thus showing planning (and not the sensation as in other works, from the potential being with you in favor of chaotic twists) to having pornography as a background on the female independence that ""X"" discusses, in addition to the degradation of humanity in the face of banal repressions and vanities. The title of the film follows the beauty of the mystery that is Maxine, being referred to as an x-factor, a difference, someone of notable and special quality. The character is enigmatic, with few dialogues, but who does not spare herself when she needs to impose her personality and preferences, and there is a shock in this profile when she is close to Pearl, the scary lady, who runs the farm alongside her husband, Howard (Stephen Ure).\nThe way Pearl is presented draws attention due to the setting's always dim lighting, her intimidating posture and her undeniable feeling of being seduced by Maxine. While the young woman's search, in which each decision is a consequence of the strength and success of her autonomy, is what defines her trajectory, for Pearl, facing a woman who in her own youth exudes freedom, confronts her denial, bitterness and dissatisfactions that hide in her idyllic farm. Giving more strength to this dichotomy, her names become an allegory in how Pearl (pearl) sees herself, with Maxine (maximum) being the example of achievement that she did not achieve, although her name refers to something precious, lasting. Therefore, Eliot Rockett's photography was fundamental for maintaining a careful play of shadows to manifest a character lost in repressed feelings.\nStill on the technical side, photography and costumes stand out in recreating an atmosphere that takes us directly to the films of the 70s to this ""X"" - everything looks like a vintage filter). And before I say that everything seems too ""artificial"" or ""decorated"", Ti West brings out the great cast who, super comfortable in their roles, make the fun happen. The script and the construction of the characters have weight in this, with the twist that the protagonist's plot undergoes in the last moments being one of the best moments of this creation. The discussion between puritanism and ""sin"", a classic slasher subplot, is turned inside out by a body of well-developed characters and highlighted in excellent dialogues that subvert the roles traditionally imposed by society - something that is not surprising to us, given that it seems We are much more likely to see coherence and integrity in a bunch of porn artists than in ""church rats"" and religious conservatives in general.\nBy openly gesturing to the slasher audience with such clear affiliations to the subgenre's conventions, Ti West doesn't seem concerned with the predictability factor. After the first murder takes place, the feature film simply relies on the construction of the graphic aspect of the deaths, losing a little interest in the atmosphere of suspense that had created such an interesting and rich panel in its first half. The games with the supposed clandestinely of pornographic films, with the artistic intentions of the jealous beginner filmmaker, with the clichés linked to the performers of productions for adult consumption, with the stereotyping of almost caricatural villains and even with the texture of the image, come out. A sequence of savage eliminations of outsiders linked to cinema. Among these deaths, there are some filmed with ingenuity and very well calculated touches of cruelty - like the lady stabbing someone until the knife gets stuck in a vertebra. There are others that are practically jokes with certain recurrences of terror - like someone who clearly shouldn't look into the holes in a stable wall. But, overall, this somewhat repetitive carnage (brief isolation of the character about to die plus conclusion with touches of nonsense) serves as much as its intertextuality weighs, the balance of which is the commotion provoked through the sharing of familiarity with the pillars from slasher.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

It definitely boasts a fantastic retro vibe and a creepy, dreamlike atmosphere that lingers with you. There's a palpable sense of unease and impending doom throughout, which I absolutely loved. Additionally, Mia Goth delivers a stupendous performance in both her roles as Pearl and Maxxine. Her character, Pearl, is undeniably creepy and scary. The movie also features some brilliantly unhinged kills.\nHowever, the film does suffer from a disjointed narrative and, at times, feels like a parody. It gives the impression of being a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie.

Maybe this was filmed pre-Wednesday, but Jenna Ortega and Kid Cudi likely aren't cheap, and they dropped some serious needles on the soundtrack. The acting was great, the cinematography was great, and Ti West did an awesome job on the writing and direction. It dragged a bit towards the beginning, as these films tend to do, however a few of the things set up turned out to be Chekhov's Guns. The dialogue isn't remarkable, but there were times I was caught off guard by something realistic like ""oh yeah, that's probably what would actually happen if an 80lb octogenarian fired a gun"", and it attempts to address topics like aging and the meaning of love, which is ambitious for a slasher film. The characters had some depth, so I was invested in their struggles. There were multiple eye-roll moments, which goes with the genre. The special effects were pretty good.\nSince they were released in the same year I had to read the trivia to figure out this was filmed before Pearl, and while I thought the twist at the end of X was clever, the previews for 'Pearl' make it look like she was some kind of wacky killer before the start of X, which I think would hurt her character more than add to it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

The movie is very minor porn, major horror, which is towards the end of the movie. Wayne is a director, and he sees the home market for porno movies as very lucrative. He has the blonde (Bobby Lynne), the stud (Jackson), his girlfriend Maxine, the camera man RJ and his girlfriend, Lorraine, the sound person. They even have a script. In the era it is set (1979) small hand held cameras, all-in-one, were not a thing. One can quibble that he would need lots of lighting, but that is not bad for this movie. RJ also wants to film with a nod to more European artistic touches. To keep things low key, Walter had rented a building on a remote southern farm, owned by an old couple, Howard and Pearl. They were married before WW I, and Pearl was a dancer, and is very aware of her faded looks. And Howard declines sex, as he is afraid of a heart attack. Things seem to be a bit creepy, but after Lorraine wants a role in the picture, RJ decides to storm off, take the van and strand everyone. Bad idea, and this is when the horror starts. There are parts of the movie that are done extremely well, and other parts more mundane.

I could see there was a lot more going on beneath the surface than I think other people my age wanted to understand, and I could appreciate that. I never tumbled all the way down this rabbit hole like the kids did, but I knew enough.\nThis is a very technically competent movie but it feels 100% laser targeted at existing fans of Freddy Fazbear. There are so many parts that, for people under the age of 18, are undoubtedly big epic lore references. But the movie does not do an especially great job at bridging the gap to those a little less familiar with things. You get the broad strokes, I guess, but there are mysteries that got teased out over the course of 4-5 games that are bluntly one and done here. It's the sort of thing that's only interesting if you're already familiar with the source material.\nThings about it feel really contrived for the sake of having a movie. Like the fact that Josh Hutcherson is over 30, but he's the big brother to a little girl who is maybe 8 years old? Mom and Dad don't seem to be in the picture anymore because, what, Mom gave birth when she was pushing 50? Or what about the whole thing with the guy taking drugs so he can repeatedly hallucinate the day his little brother was abducted in order to uncover some sort of deeper meaning? It's pretty bizarre.\nAlso how about the fact this movie just isn't scary? Like, at all? Even if you consider the games to be simple jump scare factories, the movie does an extremely poor job replicating that mood. It's too busy with fandom wish fulfillment to remember to be scary. I'm surprised they even bothered trying to show blood, because that is not the tone this movie is trying to convey.\nI'm not even sure it's worth singing praise for Jim Henson Creature Shop here, given how simple these designs are, and how deliberately stiff and stilted the characters move. Feels like a waste of talent.\nHonestly, as someone who used to like these games back in the day, I was ultimately pretty bored by this whole production.

Not at one point throughout the movie did I feel like I genuinely cared about any of it, even though I tried to. There was no suspense, horror or fun.

The story is interesting with teenagers able to contact spirits with a mysterious embalmed hand. I really like the idea of holding a mysterious hand to contact spirts and then say ""I let you in"" so it possessed that person. It really shows how it is a bad idea to do those types of things and how they affect someone. The movie is also a subject matter of grief and obsession with the main character losing her mother and wanting to contact her. It really shows how far someone can do in order to talk to a loved one again. The movie also works as a psychological horror with the main character struggling with her grief and obsession towards her mother and that hand throughout.

As a true directorial debut from Michael Philippou and Danny Philippou, it stands out as a great success. The film introduces a new and creative idea with a fun and energetic style, although there are some minor bumps along the way. The immersive world-building captivates viewers instantly, evoking a sense of wonder. The characters, portrayed by a talented cast, are relatable with both their strengths and flaws. Sophie Wilde's standout performance handles complex emotions with finesse. The scares are well-executed, avoiding cheap thrills and are instead blended seamlessly into the narrative. While some moments may elicit a humorous reaction depending on the viewing situation, the overall experience is enjoyable. The film strikes a balance in exploring its storyline without overexplaining or underexploring, which I feel is a great choice. Certain sequences are difficult to watch due to some intense and gruesome violence; however, I believe that because the film makes you feel this way, it adds to the experience and showcases the brilliance of how the film is crafted.

The Aussie made ""Talk to Me"" appears in practically every list, and quite high to boot, so I tried to squeeze it into my viewing schedule before the year is over.\nAs too often the case, sadly, I must say I'm not overly impressed with it, although admittedly it does contain a few original elements and two or three genuinely frightening and shocking moments. One of the original elements is the basic premise. In ""Talk to Me"", demonic/spiritual possession is presented as the newest hype in party-drug sensation.\nForget taking pills or sniffing gas. It's sufficient to grab the embalmed hand relic and say the titular words, and you go into a trance where you get hallucinations of the ghosts of random deceased people that make you do all sorts of crazy stuff. The spectators obviously film everything with their smartphones and put it on YouTube or Instagram. Evidently, this is bound to go wrong, and it does when teenager Mia learns that one of her friends gets in contact with the ghost of her dead mother during his trance. Mia breaks the ""rules"" of the possession's maximal duration, and it has extremely painful consequences for the medium.\nThe idea is good, Sophie Wilde's performance is intense, and there are a couple of excruciatingly agonizing moments you won't forget very soon (featuring a teenager's face and a table), but there too many defaults and unanswered questions. For me, at least. Where does the embalmed hand come from? Why aren't there any adults aware of the new hype even though it's all around the internet? I'm sure these questions, and several more unasked ones, will be answered in a long franchise of sequels, prequels, spin-offs. I will watch those eventually, of course, but I was still hoping for a more satisfying original. In this genre, I liked ""Smile"" better.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

I won't watch another movie by Yorgos Lanthimos again. If you want to watch an odd film that was done very well, go watch The Banshees of Inisherin.

I felt it was hard to get past the stilted/robotic way everybody spoke in the beginning - I'm assuming that was purposeful. And there were small gaps in the story - which again, I'm assuming was intentional and was up the the viewer to sort out. Everything eventually smoothed out and the perceived iciness amongst the family and friends became easier to translate. I'm hit & miss w/this creator's past films and this film falls somewhere in the middle. However - the casting was expertly done and it's a true testament to Kenough's talents watching him play someone much younger than his actual years, and still scare the crap out of you. This actor is also new to my awareness and I'm 'chasing' his work so I can watch more of him. He plays such odd characters - all different in their own right - but all still odd.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1e8,tt5715874,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,fernandoschiavi,16 December 2023,8,"The film is a retelling of the Greek tragedy Iphigenia. In the text written by Euripides around 2,400 years ago, King Agamemnon kills a sacred deer during a hunt and thus incurs the wrath of the goddess Artemis, who demands a sacrifice from him: he must kill his daughter Iphigenia, or the winds will not leave the ships of the king to set sail to wage war in Troy. For Agamemnon, it was a very difficult, almost impossible choice. Lanthimos updates the dilemma (the first scene, of a heart beating during surgery, indicates in a very literal way that Steven takes other people's lives into his hands - more than he would like or feel prepared to do, in fact). Above all, the director renews the foundations of Euripides' text - in his own deeply uncomfortable, and also fascinating, way.\nThe atmosphere established by Lanthimos around these characters has the desired instigating effect, however, unlike ""The Lobster"", in which the eccentricity of the ensemble still allowed space for broader issues to be explored - such as incommunicability, loneliness or brokenness. Of the pre-established concepts that guide romantic relationships - here the filmmaker offers an exercise in style that seems to end in itself. Something that would be valid if ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" was assumed as such from the beginning. The feeling that remains, however, is that, with each shot, Lanthimos aims for something much more complex. The erudite soundtrack, the traveling shots through the corridors, the enigmatic close-ups, the abrupt cuts, everything suggests a gravity, an air of importance, that never materializes. There is a clear attempt to impose a metaphysical meaning, see Martin's never-explained ""powers"", to this bourgeois guilt that befalls Steven's family, proving liable to divine punishment - the reaffirmation of the contrast of the Murphys' wealthy life with the boy's modest reality denotes this. However, such intentions never surpass the barrier of Lanthimos's provocative impetus, which ends up undermining the possibility of deeper reflections in favor of the need to create moments of shock, almost always effective, but often gratuitous - from the opening shot that shows a real cranioplasty to Alicia Silverstone's short cameo as Martin's mother. The tense climax, with echoes of ""Gratuitous Violence (1997)"", by Michael Haneke, whose latent nihilism exerts a great influence on Lanthimos, summarizes well the qualities and weaknesses of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". Because, despite being impactful at first, it ends up not resonating with the imagined force, leaving an almost indifferent void.\nThe visual strategy of Lanthimos and director of photography Thimios Bakatakis contributes to the effectiveness of this strange universe, obviously, the constant use of wide angles that not only deform the scenes on their sides but also expand them in their depth, leaving the characters even smaller and more fragile (and the fact that they are normally displaced to a lower quadrant of the plane is another fabulous language resource). Lanthimos creates an aseptic, hollow universe that gives voice to the muted feelings he tries to convey, so that the most important feelings here-guilt and revenge-come into natural focus. His use of an extreme plongée on the hospital staircase where Steven works, after a still camera sequence, is particularly beautiful, poetically combining with the existential emptiness and apathy of Farrell's character. Embodying Kubrick, the director uses and abuses symmetrical takes and tracking shots which, despite functioning as what Americans would call eye candy, often do not seem to have greater functions than the decorations they are, which only contributes to distract the viewer and give a longer duration than the tape needed to be. Furthermore, sometimes the script devolves into excessively expository texts that break the subtlety of the narrative presented. Particularly unnecessary moments are those that expose the question of culpability, making obvious what had already been marked between the lines. These are, perhaps, the only moments in which Lanthimos bows to the ""need for explanations"" that permeates productions that intend to go beyond their market niche, something that also briefly marks ""The Lobster"". It's understandable and doesn't discredit the experience, but it's a habit that the director would do well to suppress in future works to embrace once and for all the weird and bizarre side, as in ""Dogtooth"".\nThe first relevant point to consider here is that it hovers between psychological horror and a fantasy drama. The award-winning script by Lanthimos and Filippou is fundamental in the slow but progressive construction of this tension, at a pace of psychological horror: it is designed to never leave the audience relieved. Even though nothing is said explicitly, forcing the viewer to search their heads for explanations for what would be happening on the screen. It is very interesting how the dialogues gradually gain drama in their tone, as the characters, small and lonely in the midst of plans that oppress them, fall into despair. Only then do we realize that the film is the agonizing story of a reckoning that borders on the surreal - and karmic. Lanthimos chooses not to provide definitive answers about his proposal. However, without this harming the development of the given topic. Its direction is dry, direct, and does not fail to show violence. The soundtrack plays an important role, as at some points in the film it increases in volume until it becomes distressing to be in the armchair watching that situation. The dialogues between the characters are devoid of emotions. Lanthimos manages to reveal to the viewer how forced and even ridiculous the repeated dialogues between people are to the point of being empty words. When Martin, the dead patient's son, begins to demand more of Steven's presence, we realize that the film goes further, creating chaos in the doctor's life that begins a chain of questioning about the attitudes of all the characters present. The plot has great surprises that deserve to be preserved, so that the viewer can really get into it.\nBlood is an essential element in Lanthimos' film. It appears in the first scene, is mentioned as Kim's menstruation, is involved in violence, and even in the appearance of a simple ketchup. The blood refers to Christ, to the innocence of the sacrificed deer, at the same time as it is involved in violence between men. Science, in the context of the film, serves as a counterpoint to Nature: by using it, someone who should value life destroyed one out of ego and irresponsibility. Therefore, the entire film seems to be an angry response from Nature or from some undefined deity that charges those who act in the name of the illusory power that Medicine can give to control life. Ultimately, the film reveals a disturbing coldness in its characters' decisions. With a plot that involves the viewer in doubt about the sequence of events, in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" it is possible to be carried away by the anguish of trying to understand how fantastic the story goes and remain thinking about the film after the session.\nThe film's atmosphere now has a discreet biblical context (hence the maxim ""God gives and God takes away""), but still maintains certain characteristics of a Greek tragedy (and the symbolisms that refer to the sacrifice and dilemma of a man in conflict are examples). Steven Murphy, as the man of science, is rendered powerless by being just a man in the hands of mysterious forces; His profession becomes useless in saving his family (a detail that is, to say the least, ironic). Martin, as a result, gains the image of an Old Testament God, charged with wrath. If his father died in surgery, Steven will then need to sacrifice someone (the ""sacred deer"") to balance everything. In fact, these details are absolutely interesting, as they are already anticipated through the wide-angle camera angles. She, at various times, remains above Steven, as if she were God.\nPerhaps Lanthimos' genius lies in making surgery the film's great metaphor (it is cold and precise). Not only is Steven as cold as his profession, but the film's atmosphere, soundtrack, dialogue and acting are also cold. Everything is cold, latent and little demonstrated. Any coldness is on purpose, as that is what the director wanted to create. Notice how everything, so inexpressive, ends up ""expressing"" terror and pessimism. Coldness is what defines ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". As stable, calculated and ""surgical"" as its system is, a simple crooked line or a crescendo of music can be the prelude to chaos. And this film walks a fine line. The film ends on the right note, almost with symmetry, matching the coldness of its introduction. The heart of the first scene connects with the sacrifice in the Murphy family (but in different senses). His conclusion indicates that Martin is the representation of God. In the last scene, he is sitting on a bench in a restaurant, and is not even seen by the Murphys (except for Kim, who gives him a look). He is like God: he is there, he is felt, but he is not seen. There is no more sacrifice, and that family no longer owes you anything. Everything then ends.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1ea,tt5715874,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,The-Last-Prydonian,29 November 2023,4,"Renowned cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Steven Murphy lives an idyllic life with his wife and two children. When he befriends a fatherless teenager named Martin, the young man proceeds to inveigle his way deeper and deeper into the doctor's life. Soon, Martin's dark intentions become apparent when Martin reminds him of a past transgression which will permanently shatter the domesticity of his household.\nThe latest offering from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos who collaborates once again with Colin Farrell, whom he worked with on his equally idiosyncratic The Lobster. It is no exaggeration to describe The Killing of a Sacred Deer as a deeply surreal and perturbing look at a man whose family's life is turned upside down by an unstable teenager. Inspired by the ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides, like The Lobster, Lanthimos's movie is clearly experimental in nature in so much, as for reasons that appear only clear to himself his cast delivers their performances in a stilted and wooden style. The artificiality of this is only matched by Lanthimos's script which he co-wrote with Efthimis Filippou. It's pretty much robotic as if his protagonists escaped from the Stepford Wives.\nAt the movie's heart, there is a good movie with a sublimely bizarre and surreal plot and Lanthimos manages to add a nuanced, somber and unsettling tone. There is something of a cold sterility to the Murphy household which may account for the unorthodox style of acting on display. Suffice to say that like The Lobster there is an underlying touch of the absurd to it's plot which no doubt owes a measure of debt to the avant-garde work of David Lynch, while there are hints of the Oscar winning psychological thriller Fatal Attraction.\nBarry Keoghan, who would later feature alongside fellow Irishman Farrell in the black tragicomedy does have something of an unsettling presence as well as a awkwardness about him as the disturbed young antagonist. However, Lanthimoas can't overcome the weight of his own artistic pretensions with the stagy style of his direction and the constrained acting by his cast bog it down considerably. Which is a shame because there was a potentially good if very strange movie that had the potential to be so much more than it actually is.\nNeedless to say as well that the considerable talents of both Farrell and Keoghan feel wasted, and deserved better than what they are left to work with. And Nicole Kidman has done considerably better with the similarly off-kilter and dark Stoker, just seems to be infinitely bored with everything that's gone on around her. One has to wonder if her involvement is due to any artistic merit she thought the movie had or merely for the paycheck. Either way The Killing of a Sacred Deer feels like something of a missed opportunity from Lanthimoas whose seems to have fallen prey to his own overreaching ambitions.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1ed,tt5715874,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,viniciusmarchesin,6 November 2023,8,"Robotically delivered lines, unsettling camera angles, elements of fantasy and characters that never bother asking why or how. Love it or hate it, these are the features of Lanthimos' work and I believe he has succeeded once again with his formula.\nBe the kafkaesque elements of characters living in an apparently rational world filled with beings that behave very much like children precisely because of how blindly they follow abstract bureaucratic rules or the dry and satirical Roy Anderson type of humor, in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, illogic becomes plausible, guilt goes unexplained, and brutal punishment is doled out.\nConstant unexpected turns in the plot often joined by an overly dramatic soundtrack (which consists mainly of baroque and classical pieces) make for a more intense ride than his previous movies, especially giving the sense of urgency the characters face. Like in The Lobster time is of the essence, unlike it though, the comical moments here are few. Do not be fooled by the colorful palette either, this is by far Lanthimos' most violent and dark movie (it has been produced by A24 afterall).\nIf I were to criticize anything about the movie it would have to be Nicole Kidman. Not her role nor her acting, but herself. Simply put, she does not fit the overall aesthetic of the movie, she feels out of place.\nWhile it's true that watching characters facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible pain may seem like a weird way to spend your leisure time, I will go out on a limb here (as an attempt to reply to some of the haters in the comments as well) and say that whilst Lanthimos makes use of make-believe elements, underneath it lays realism. How different is the curse that haunts Steven's family from, let's say, cancer? - Or any other illness for that matter. What about the unhinged and disjointed family connections? How often are we also not the victims of unmeasurable irrationalities in a supposedly well reasoned society?\nMaybe it's precisely the epic perspectives and narratives that allows us to best see our lives for what they truly are, a chaotic mess.

WAYYYYYYY BETTER in the film ""the father"" with anthony hopkins. That film is a MASTERCLASS of showing insanity in a way that a sane person can understand. This movie is extremely bad from any perspective and Ari Aster should know better. Come on Ari you know how to make a good film stop slacking bro.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

Beau is better than Midsommar. It's a completely different film. It's absurd cinema to the fullest, but that's okay. I was onboard for the 1st 2 hours of this anxiety ridden nightmare. It was funny and batshit and I hoped it would continue to be until the very last frame. And it wasn't. It's almost as if Ari went against everything he gave us for the first two full hours. He suddenly made an attempt to explain every absurd frame in his film. He swung for the fences, but he came up short of the homer.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1f9,tt3850590,Krampus,gettodamoofies,26 December 2023,7,"FILM: 7/10.\nReturning to the 2015 film Krampus, I find Michael Dougherty, the maestro behind the delightfully twisted Trick 'r Treat, turning his attention to the holiday season. Much like his Halloween gem, Krampus serves as a refreshing counter-programming to the saccharine sweet Christmas fare, blending comedy and horror in a way that nods to classics like Gremlins.\nThe family at the film's centre is well cast, each member contributing to the chaos in their own unique way. It's a dysfunctional family dynamic that feels authentic, adding an extra layer of relatability to the unfolding madness. There's a chemistry that makes their descent into holiday horrors all the more entertaining, with Adam Scott and Toni Collette barely containing their frustration at the family members descending on their home.\nCreature design is a standout feature, with the monstrous creations adding a touch of macabre whimsy to the Christmas setting. Dougherty successfully crafts a festive nightmare, where gingerbread men and demonic toys become unlikely antagonists in the battle for holiday cheer.\nKrampus is undeniably a fun film, leaning into its darkly comedic moments while maintaining a genuine sense of peril. The blend of horror and humor hits the right notes, creating an experience that's both chilling and amusing. It's a reminder that the festive season isn't always sugar and spice, but sometimes a dash of horror adds the perfect kick.\nAs the credits roll, Krampus leaves you with a playful warning - if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you might just be doomed for life. It's a cheeky nod to the film's mischievous spirit, proving that holiday horrors can be a delightful gift for those who appreciate a bit of bite with their Christmas bark. A festive frightfest that keeps the holiday spirit twisted and thrilling.\nFORMAT: Blu-ray\nVIDEO: 9/10.\n1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: Excellent\nAUDIO: 9.5/10.\nDTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: Excellent\nMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

I really wanted to watch it this year tough and with Christmas coming i did just that on the 21st.\nOverall... not a bad movie, but nothing really special, yet fine for one watch. Its actually a comedy mixed with horror while keeping the Christmas atmosphere in full force.\nThe Krampus monster himself is actually not that present. It revolves around all his minions wich all have special imaginative designs. That said they pretty much all CGI animated and they kinda look goofy at time. I guess they were inspired by Tim Burton in some way.\nThe issue is im never sure if i should take this movie seriously or not. Is it supose to be a comedy or is it supose to be horror? Maybe its supose to be a mix of the 2 just like i think it is? Who knows. But its not ""that funny"" while its not scary at all.\nThis one get the yellow heart only by a tiny little margin.

Starting off like your typical Christmas film, the plot quickly starts to send shivers down your spine as you realize this has much more in store. The story is fun and exciting, with a perfectly unsettling ending to top it off and keep with its creepier elements. The cast is comprised of familiar faces and some talented children actors. While they mostly maintain a fun ride, some of the jokes can feel quite cheesy or stale, with the dialogue being almost satirical at times. As a Christmas movie, it certainly has the holiday element, but as a horror movie, the fear and unnerving nature are some of the best parts. While I didn't expect much going in, Krampus delivers a delightfully eerie tale that I have found myself running back to, time and time again.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

Like many horror films, it was dismissed when it first came out for really inexplicable reasons, but I'm happy it seems to be getting a well-deserved reassesment. Because, what's not to love here?\nYou have a truly AMAZING cast, with great performances from Adam Scott, Toni Collette (!), David Koechner, and even the kids, who are mostly pretty solid actors and do well with the material. It has fantastic practical effects that pay homage to Rankin Bass Christmas classics, only much darker and more twisted.\nThe story is fun and creative, subverting the saccharine wish fulfillment of most Christmas tales, for one that has a child invoking a spirit that's almost cosmic in its power and completely unstoppable. I LOVE how Krampus is presented here as a villain; not just the awesome practical creature they made, but how much power he has and fear he induces. It's just fantastic.\nNot to mention this movie is FUNNY. It has a great sense of humour and doesn't take itself too seriously. It validates a lot of the feelings people have about the holiday season, mainly about having to share a table and fake smile for family members you wouldn't associate with otherwise and the cynical consumerism Christmas promotes. However, like all good Christmas movies, the message is simple: family matters. Making it work regardless of your differences matter. Just when you think the film settles for a sweet, uplifting ending, it delivers one of the most bleak, brilliant ones I've seen for a Christmas horror film.\nYeah, Krampus is a ton of fun. If you need a break from holiday cheer, even if temporarily, check it out.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b1ff,tt3850590,Krampus,I_Ailurophile,9 December 2023,9,"The foundations are tried and true, a scenario that's been the basis of many holiday films for decades: an abundance of outwardly unlikable characters, the false manufactured cheer of Christmas set against abject cynicism about the worst aspects of the holidays in modern life, minimal representation of innocence (usually the very young) amidst a cornucopia of cringe and dreariness. To that foundation, of course, we add in this case a frightful supernatural entity drawn directly from European folklore, and presto! - 2015 horror-comedy 'Krampus.' Mind you, in this case the genre label is a bit of a misnomer; there are stunningly few outright laughs to be had in these ninety-seven minutes, and the ""comedy"" descriptor speaks more to the fragments of wry, black humor that marginally lighten the horror. To that point, despite how the picture was marketed, this is substantially darker than I expected, with grim atmosphere and grisly violence exceeding what some straightforward horror sometimes achieves; modicums of levity can't begin to meaningfully touch the most dour facets of the movie. I do like it, but suffice to say that this is not what I anticipated.\nSparsely peppered with quick-witted lines that provide counterbalance, the preponderance of the length is characterized by shrewd use of light and shadow, incredibly unsettling unnatural movement, sounds, or visions, a tense and acutely disquieting score, and superb art direction that very distinctly cements the bleak, brutal ambience. This is to say nothing of surprisingly strong violence, imaginative and unnerving creature designs, and excellent stunts and effects; the computer-generated imagery looks fantastic, and to whatever extent the digital wizardry doesn't blend into the filmed footage, this is an instance where the disparity rather adds to the experience. Even the sound effects are plainly outstanding and further the harrowing airs about the feature, not to mention the costume design, hair, and makeup. Filmmaker Michael Dougherty, and co-writers Todd Casey and Zach Shields, concocted a wonderfully twisted nightmare that warps familiar Christmastime themes and ideas into an invigorating thrill ride that at some points rather becomes hard to watch for just how unremittingly sinister and cheerless the concatenation becomes. 'Krampus' is fun, yes, but in a manner very much unlike how it was promoted and spoken of since before its release.\nThe narrative is sharp, potent, and stridently gloomy through to the very end; the fact that it does manage to be earnest and impactful at the same time is genuinely impressive. Equally punchy scene writing keeps us firmly locked in while maximizing the harsh, charged energy and every feeling, and much the same can be said for Dougherty's keen direction. The length passes very quickly as the tale grows ever more severe, and if anything, the casting in this rarely funny horror flick of actors largely known for their work in comedies only heightens the gripping tone and accentuates how far removed this is from how it initially presents. Case in point, Toni Collette is not known for appearing in genre titles, yet like Ari Aster's masterful 'Hereditary,' this is an exception in which her participation serves to amplify the intended effect, and emphasize the underlying gravity. Collette, David Koechner, Adam Scott, Allison Tolman, Conchata Ferrell, Krista Stadler, and even young Emjay Anthony, among others, all give splendid performances of real range, nuance, and emotional depth while being perfectly suited to the gnarly cavalcade of violence that the film broadly represents.\nTruthfully, I had mixed expectations when I sat to watch; I assumed I'd enjoy 'Krampus,' but I wasn't sure just how good and worthwhile it would really turn out to be. I'm pleased to say that when all is said and done, it's even better than I could have hoped. I think the heavy focus on horror over comedy actually serves the picture well, for it's made more fully absorbing and satisfying in its darkness; not only are the scant lighter touches more consequential in turn, but it seems as if the writers worked overtime to make the comedy smarter (that is, both more intelligent and more cheeky). The end result of all this is a genre romp that manages to hit considerably harder than it would seem from the outside looking in, or from the outset. Crafted with utmost skill and well made in all regards, it's both entertaining and riveting, and handily surpasses most other movies that try to play at the same intersection of horror and holidays. I'm so very happy with just how good this is, and for anyone who is open to the amalgamation, 'Krampus' earns my very high and enthusiastic recommendation!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

These arguments causes Krampus to start haunting these guys.\nThe in-laws were the most unlikable characters in this film. Theres nothing good about them expect for the gun guy who had the only line I found acceptably funny. The rest of the jokes, and comedy tries are terrible, misplaced or just corny and dont fit in with the film.\nThe movies setting is mostly set in the house as theres a blizzard outside they can't get out. This setting creates almost a claustrophobic effect which worked well. No electricity so its only candle light which brings Krampus' elves and his other monsters to feel much more scary.\nThis film is basically horror movie 101 its basic and pretty predictable. Its basically like a home invasion film with a evil santa. The ending is very weak and unsatisfying.\nLittle cookie ginger bread men were amazing best part of the film. The rest of the helpers were pretty bad, except the jack box thing that opened its mouth like Pennywise and ate a kid. The CGI is decent in this film with Krampus being the highlight, we see him up close close to the end but I feel like it would of been better if he was more of a mystery. Seeing him close in the dark next to the grandma was great, his long sharp claws without seeing his face was better.\nFirst time we see Krampus was great. Him on the rooftop jumping from one house to another. All we can see is the dark outline of him and that was the most scary part of the film, creepy, huge thing with horns jumping on roofs.\nWith all its flaws its one of the better Christmas horror films out there.

They're almost all worth watching if in the mood, but the lack of stillness in the camera, the constant cuts, quick quips, punchathons and artificial visuals get tiring after a while.\nMidsommar is a fine antidote: the camera is beautifully still or slow. Editing-cuts are far less frequent, allowing more time to sink into an image. The compositioning of images is masterful: photography-like. Indeed, Kubrick-like (who was initially a photographer).\nWe also get an impactful soundtrack, excellent acting especially from the lead, good script & screenplay with plenty of quality dialogue-free sections, effectively spare FX with realistic psychedelic 'breathing' visuals, and a riveting foreboding atmosphere.\nThere's also very weird humour, which actually made me & my lady laugh out loud a few times....tho' I imagine others might just find it weird.\nThe film slightly drags in the final third (I watched the theatrical cut) and some of the character reactions will have you questioning its realism.

6595b4e0a783f0cdafc9b208,tt8772262,Midsommar,TheLittleSongbird,26 December 2023,4,"'Midsommar' (2019)\nOpening thoughts: It took me a long time to get round to watching 'Midsommar', due to not having time or the opportunity to watch it easily. Have always appreciated the genre it fits in, where there are many great films, and Florence Pugh showed a lot of promise seeing her for the first time in 'Little Women'. That it was also directed by the director responsible for the very good 'Hereditary' intrigued me too. The premise was one of those could have gone either way ones, it was advertised bizarrely and the critical reception was very polarising, particularly from those that didn't like it.\nAfter seeing 'Midsommar', count me in as somebody who didn't care for it. It is not an awful film and there are things done right, including an intriguing start, but the second half was a bizarre and tedious mess, so this viewer is this case more understanding of those who didn't like the film than liked. This has absolutely nothing to do with not understanding what 'Midsommar' was going to be or going for, quite the opposite, the issue is that it doesn't achieve its aims very well at all.\nGood things: 'Midsommar' does have good things. It is a very well made film visually, with photography that is both dreamlike and nightmarish in all the necessary places. The scenery is also absolutely beautiful, while also with a suitably ominous atmosphere. Did think too that the film started off well, with an unsettling opening that was creepy and suspenseful. The sacrifice scene was similarly suitably horrifying, with it being the scariest (and goriest) the film got.\nRegarding the acting, to me it was quite good considering what was given to them (which actually come to think of it wasn't much). Pugh anchors the film beautifully in a compellingly tortured lead performance.\nBad things: However, there are also a lot of drawbacks. Most of the characters are incredibly thinly sketched and behave annoyingly and/or illogically. Pugh has the only character that has any development or who is interesting. Some friends thought that Will Poulter's character had the most personality, to me actually he was annoying and his presence jarred with the rest of the atmosphere. The direction did have some slickness but got very slack and muddled later on the more weird the second half became.\nThe script has nothing memorable, is very stilted and can fall into self-indulgence. The story and pacing are the weakest aspects of 'Midsommar'. The story starts off with great atmosphere and intrigue, but post the sacrifice scene any creepiness and sense of horror pretty much completely goes. Meaning that the second half is incredibly long winded, this out increasingly (at times non-existent) and is bizarre to the point of near-incoherence. Especially the dragged out and truly daft climax that ends on an abrupt, incomplete feeling note and one of the silliest and most unintentionally funny sex scenes in recent years.\nSome of the intended creepy behaviours of the cult were potentially unnerving and sounded it on paper but were under-explored and/or left as loose ends or implied. A much shorter length definitely would have helped the pacing and atmosphere, the film is overlong and could have easily been trimmed by 25-30 minutes which would have tightened the pace. Which would have been achieved if scenes were made shorter and if motivations went into more detail.\nClosing thoughts: Overall, underwhelming.\n4/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

It was fresh if perhaps a bit bloated at times but it worked due to the plot's structure.\nSo I was pretty stoked for this one. How many pure day light horror films are there? The Wicker Man (original) of which this film pays homage too, basically remakes it. And that is where ultimately, I was disappointment.\nFirst the good: The film is beautifully shot and minus 2 scenes the entire thing takes place in bright green fields of Sweden (shot in Hungary)\nIt accomplishes merging beauty with horror in a way I haven't ever seen before (The Flower Dress)\nIf you're a gore hound beyond just ""MORE GORE!"" then you may find certain scenes shocking (the cliff scene) as I did. It's not overly gory but with a background so beautiful for the heinous actions by both villagers and visitors it's quite jarring.\nThere is also a suicide scene that raises a good question regarding how we ""civilized"" people tend to push our old/sick into institutions never to be seen again. Who are visitors to judge the customs of these ""sacred"" people?\nSadly that theme is not explored and I found every character minus Dani to be interchangeable in their terribleness\nIn closing.\nIt feels like the director was, poorly, trying to remake the ultimate cult classic using the same methods that worked so well for his previous hit that what we end up with is a film that is\n100% predictable from start to finish. In other words I found it boring.\nI wanted to love it but didn't. I am very happy it was made as I think Ari Aster is an incredibly talented director who knows how to bring the terror and I look forward to his next work. I just hope he tries something unique and fun to watch.\nTLDR: This film follows the themes of Hereditary with zero twists, and while it is a gorgeous (and morbid) work of art- I didn't like it or hate it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,

Some scenes and traditions of the Hågra are too random to not have set off our protagonists in real life.\nSaid protagonists are paper thin in the film, it's all about the Hågra and the setting.\nI will say this film is interesting from a scandinavian perspective, because it features a lot of swedish actors and a lot of blonde people.

The evil takes over the lives of Jimi and Pedro slowly and painfully. The audience assists to this inevitable ascent of the darkness that multiple times outsmart the characters, despite all the precautions and strategies that they apply. The director took a realistic approach and some elements of the story are raw and credible. There is no unjustified over the top violence and no pointless jumpscares. The script takes the time to deepen the backstory of Pedro and his family, making him vulnerable and relatable to the eyes of the audience. The narration is fervid and there are many tense sequences that deliver some unexpected moments. This is in my opinion what made the first half great. Unfortunately the film starts to lose its appeal midway. All the tension that built up completely disappeared in the second part of the film. The protagonist takes impulsive decisions that have no logic and that will cost him dearly. In my opinion this goes against the nature of the character, that from the beginning constantly warns others how to kill the possessed, without contracting the curse. The ending is very dramatic and it leaves things open for a possible sequel (that most likely will not happen). Overall I liked the general concept of this film, but the director (who is also the screenwriter) made some decisions that prevented this film from achieving its true potential. ""When Evil Lurks"" could be one of the best 2023 horror movies, but unfortunately it only gets a 6. It is still a solid film, but I was expecting way better.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

New Meg. Old Chum. Back for seconds. There is always another one. Terror has never run this deep...Fear runs deep.\nYou already know that this movie is about a prehistoric mega-shark rising from the depths and terrorizing the scientists crew. An inferior and literally larger-than-life thrill ride that supersizes the 2018 blockbuster and takes the action to higher heights and even greater depths with multiple massive Megs and so much more.

Stars Jason Statham giving his ordinary acting as a two-fisted veteran deep-sea rescue diver must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below.

Collaborating with lead Mia Goth, they churned out a script for Pearl, the prequel to X, and A24 greenlit it for shooting before a single frame of X was seen. Turns out, it was a smart decision. Pearl not only stands as an excellent film in its own right but also surpasses its predecessor.\nTi West and his team maintain consistency with X, yet Pearl takes a wholly different approach. While X had a grungy, grainy look capturing the essence of 1979, Pearl embraces a clean, vibrant, and pure aesthetic - a perfect reflection of how the character Pearl sees herself in the world.\nUnlike X's ensemble approach, Pearl places the load on Mia Goth's shoulders, and she delivers a fantastic performance. As a psychotic imitation of Judy Garland's Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, Goth brings a unique and captivating energy to her character. David Corenswet, known for being the newly cast Superman, impresses as the Projectionist, giving me an opportunity to witness his talent beyond a single House of Cards episode.\nMuch like X, Pearl takes its time with the horror elements, and when the terror unfolds, it's as gloriously entertaining as its predecessor. What sets it apart, however, is its effectiveness in contrasting with the vibrant experience earlier in the film. Ti West's Pearl is a smart and visually striking prequel that successfully navigates the horror genre with finesse, proving that even in quarantine, creative risks can pay off. Ultimately, it stands as a superior counterpart to X.\nFORMAT: Blu-ray\nVIDEO: 10/10.\n1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: Excellent\nAUDIO: 9.5/10.\nDTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: Excellent\nMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

It's barely even a film - just a bunch of acting and a thin, half-arsed script, with some pretentious and undeveloped Wizard Of Oz stylings thrown in. Scenes drag on forever, way past the point of terminal boredom, just so that Goth can show off her acting. I've never felt so much impatience and fidgeting in a cinema. The ending is supposed to be disturbing, but it just ends up being comical.\nTo put this into perspective, I thought 'X' was ok, slightly above -average but nothing special. I thought House Of The Devil was a minor classic, and I thought The Sacrament was quite effective and tense. Mia Goth is a good actor, but she always seems to play the same part.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b230,tt18925334,Pearl,fernandoschiavi,20 December 2023,7,"The year is 1918. Young Pearl (Mia Goth) has returned to live on her parents' farm after her husband Howard (Alistair Sewell) was drafted into the Great War. Pearl dreams of being a great dancer, famous throughout the country, so her frustration in returning to live at her parents' house, where she needs to take care of her sick father and is constantly humiliated by her mother, is enormous. When she discovers that a selection process for new artists in a dance company will be held in her city, Pearl sees the opportunity for the life she always wanted. But the consequences of her decision will go far beyond what she could imagine.\nCreated by Ti West and Mia Goth, and produced simultaneously with ""X"", ""Pearl"" is the sequel that many fans of the previous film didn't know they needed. Overexplaining is often condemned in horror cinema, and the story of the elderly murderer in ""X"" really required no further explanation. But West and Goth treat the character's transformation process with so much care and affection that the minimal references covered (such as the justification of the character's anger towards blondes, or the iconic gesture of silence) work almost like fan service. Just like its eponymous protagonist, ""Pearl"" is a film with many layers. It can be seen as just an origin story, but it is much more than that. It is also an essay on mental health, taking into account the psychotic tendencies demonstrated by the character from the beginning, exacerbated by the cornering imposed by her own reality.\nExplaining who the damn villain was who turned our stomachs with such graphic deaths, the prequel to ""X"" is not that classic jump scare horror, but it is definitely an impeccable essay on a psychotic break. Pearl's (Mia Goth) reality could drive anyone crazy. With her husband at war, she dedicates her days back to her parents' house, where she must take care of her father - who remains in a vegetative state -, while being constantly humiliated and mistreated by her mother. Between the chores on the farm and the palliative care that takes away her energy, she dreams of the life of a star on stage and in cinema. Always between the purest and most mind-blowing fantasy and a harsh reality never desired, she tries to chart her path towards success, fame and plastic beauty. What they didn't tell you is that in an arid land, dreams born from the field don't tend to flourish. And under a very technicolor aesthetic, which harks back to the format of films from the 50s and 60s, Ti West delivers another brilliant horror that goes much further than the combo of scares that normally awaits us in a slasher horror. ""Pearl"" is in fact a chaotic spiral of a young woman adrift of her own existence, who perishes in a mediocre life where her identity and personality are stifled and succumbed to the pressures of an aggressive, insensitive and indifferent matriarch. But regardless of the family context that brought Pearl to us, it is undeniable that villainy already lived within her, as West makes a point of showing in her tortuous way of sacrificing defenseless animals. And this construction is fundamental to turning the elderly Pearl from ""X"" into a cruel and monstrous creature in the eyes of the characters and, obviously, the audience.\nThe story takes place in the 60s, at the beginning of the 20th century. In the typical horror setting of rural, isolated and silent America, we meet Pearl (Mia Goth), a seemingly ordinary young woman in pre-Depression America. Pearl is tormented by the anguish of her husband's return from war. This anguish gives part of the tone of the film. Anxiety gives Pearl a feeling of stagnation, of being there and stuck with her family. Pearl needs to take care of her father, who needs special care. She needs to be surrounded by her mother, who judges her and weighs her relationship with the world - a classic for complex female characters. But the family does not appear to be extremely dysfunctional like in other films of the genre. With a surgical simplicity, the photography and scenography perfectly mask what lies behind this bucolic setting. Like a bad apple: rotten on the inside, but very beautiful on the outside.\nHere we have the interesting issue of mixing times and themes. A narrative with deep discussions about the feminine, family conflicts and psychoses, issues that derive from the culmination of crises between the different areas of a human being's mind, so explored in horror cinema from the seventies - there we have infinite iconic examples of characters who they stained the youthful imagination of the time with blood - but in a setting from the beginning of the 20th century. The focus on emotions and family relationships, a vulnerable and uncertain main character, who develops into a very subversive and adverse heroine's trajectory, and a lot of symbolic depth, transform ""Pearl"" into a beautiful way of making bloody cinema.\nThe film features ""gore"" scenes from the beginning, but it is in the second half that things start to get even stranger. Ti West manages to make us nervous by bringing horror scenes that take place in the dark or in broad daylight, causing that nail-biting anxiety just because we are sure that what is coming is not at all good. The characterization with more colorful tones and farm settings that bring peace, and even remind us of ""The Sound of Music"", contrast perfectly with the slasher every time blood is spilled. But terror is also in every word and attitude of the protagonist, who surprises in several moments, such as a frightening and uncut monologue seen in the final moments of the film. Pearl ends up discovering that the film industry also relies on pornography, and this discovery is crucial to the plot's relationship with ""X"", which takes place more than 60 years after ""Pearl"".\nConnecting both films in a natural and almost imperceptible way, this is a derivative that stands on its own two feet and in several moments is nothing like ""X"". With a slightly metalinguistic approach and a different narrative development, the film focuses on the self-destructive journey of a young woman who goes crazy in the face of her reality and the impossibility of her dreams. The plot of ""Pearl"" is simple, only on the surface. And this is because the complexity of the narrative does not revolve around the story itself (although it contributes, of course, to the final result), but rather, its protagonist. In this sense, Ti West's film is a beautiful character study, a lesson in how to explore the different facets of a figure and what led her to become what she became.\nIn fact, it would be unfair to praise only Ti West for the successes of ""Pearl"", given that Mia Goth is also one of the work's screenwriters and producers. The actress not only helped create an entire narrative conducive to the protagonist's transformation into a terrible villain, but also delivered an award-worthy performance (no wonder, many complained about her absence in the Best Actress category at the 2023 Oscars). It is impressive how the artist manages to reinvent herself throughout the narrative, going from a naive and hopeful girl to a disillusioned and broken woman, who rebuilds herself through a cold, villainous figure, who has no problem murdering her own parents, her love interest, husband and sister-in-law in favor of what she wants most: fame (or would it be freedom through fame?). Talking about how the actress alternates between periods of remission and psychotic episodes in a matter of seconds, or the show of expressions in her smile in the final scene, is redundant. But what she delivers in an 8-minute-long monologue in the last act of the film is astounding. The young woman's speech, filmed without cuts (seriously, the passage is exquisite), summarizes everything that Pearl carried within her: frustration, depression, sadness, anger, love, dreams and so on. All cards are laid out on the table with an emotion and intensity that are not so common to see, especially in horror films, which tend to focus much more on their scary plots than on the development of their characters. And we still couldn't fail to mention the next scene, with the ax sequence, which is simply harrowing.\nFilling its second act with a bloodthirsty that will fill the eyes of those most hungry for slashers, ""Pearl"" still makes room for a touch of humor and plays with the emotional fluctuations of its protagonist, transforming it into a small mix between horror and a sarcasm with an acidic and cutting humor. Violent but not at all scary, Ti West's newest film is something of a villain's journey. While making a number of connections, the film doesn't add anything genuinely new to ""The Mark of Death,"" it's a wonderful companion piece, the kind of conceptual horror that's so meticulously well-made, it deserves to be enjoyed even as a one-off experience. A young woman face to face with the worst version of herself.\nThe film also brings an interesting critique about fame: is anything worth it to reach the top? For Pearl, limits are non-existent and there is nothing more important than the glamor of the stage. In this sense, her blood-red clothing, used during the last act of the film, in addition to representing the deaths she carries with her, is a symbol of her passion and obsession (red usually has this connotation in cinematographic works). With a masterful performance by Mia Goth, ""Pearl"" is a pleasant surprise and hits the nail on the head when exploring the limits of a character full of traumas, dreams and frustrations who, despite everything, apparently, will never stop believing that she is a star.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b231,tt18925334,Pearl,markgorman,3 December 2023,8,"I've now seen all three of Mia Goth's extraordinary A24 movies this year. In each one she has singlehandedly carried the movie to ridiculous heights of greatness.\nAll three are billed as horror (X as a slasher, Infinity Pool as an unhinged psychopath study and Pearl as another psychopath gestational study).\nAll three deepen A24's reputation as the distributor of the year/decade, the greatest signifier of quality in moviemaking right now.\nAll three mark out Goth as the leading horror female actor in history if not, increasingly, one of the great female actors of her generation full stop.\nIt's Pearl that that confirms this most potently as her performance is jaw dropping throughout.\nIt's the origin piece for X, but the two movies could hardly be less similar, even though the central character is the same person (60 years apart) and shot on the same farm location in Kansas.\nThis tells the tale of young married Pearl with her husband labouring in the European trenches of WWII, her father a wheelchair stricken quadriplegic - a victim of the Spanish Flu which is a clever reference as it was written by Goth and Director Ti West during lockdown - and her raging mother, a German immigrant trapped by her crippled husband in rural America and resentful to the back teeth because of it.\nGoth (Pearl) wants to escape this and become a dancer but is thwarted at auditions for not being blonde enough. This triggers her inner psychopath and whilst we don't get a rampage on the scale of X we do see her nascent evil emerge.\nIt's Goth's startling performance and Ti West's dazzling direction that marks this out as a horror of sheer class, although in truth it's not really a horror at all: not a single jump scare and very little in the way of butchery.\nTwo scenes stand out, both featuring Goth, a long monologue to her friend and the closing credits which are reminiscent of Sinead Connor's classic pop video.\nThis is movie making at its finest and a must see in my opinion.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

After Psycho, the Giallos and before the classic slasher wave comes somewhat lonely Black Christmas. And here various optional basics are already being practised, the killer-me perspective, yes, before Halloween, that there doesn't necessarily need to be an obvious motive for murder and that young ladies are a favourite target of the madmen.\nBut of course we are still in the middle of the 70s.

Black Christmas was released in 1974. Which I'll be reviewing. It was then remade in 2006, and remade again in 2019. And from what I've heard about the most recent remake, it deserves the harsh criticism.\nNow as for the original: I absolutely loved it. I saddens me that horror films like this aren't produced as much anymore. It's far easier to just throw together a cheesy, terrible plot, and accent it with cheap jump scares, cringe-worthy dialogue, and visual effects nowadays. Looking back at the films that made the genre what it is today has helped me realize, at least, how much the horror genre as a whole has devolved over the years, and helps me truly appreciate the gems that come out every now and then that defy genre norms today.\nAlthough the movie is labeled a horror/slasher film, I think it effectively utilizes terror throughout, as opposed to horror. For most those words probably mean the same thing, but without spoiling anything that happens in the film, let me explain the difference between horror and terror. Horror and terror are both types of fear: horror manifests itself in known threats more often than not, whereas terror manifests in unknown/unseen threats. It's an oversimplified distinction technically, but make of that what you will before watching the movie and you will see what difference the approach to fear makes in a ""horror"" film.\nOther than the execution, the cinematography was good, the acting was good...for the most part. There were some characters that I thought could have done better, but there were no awful actors. The pacing was quite good, although I feel they could have shortened the introduction a little.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b239,tt0071222,Black Christmas,bowmanblue,16 December 2023,6,"For someone who's watched as many 'slasher' films in my time (and enjoyed many a 'gore-fest' along the way!) it's taken me until 2023 to watch 'Black Christmas,' which. If the internet trivia is to be believed, is up there with horror classics like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Halloween' - in bringing the 'slasher' genre to the mainstream.\nIt's about a killer, stalking residents of a sorority house one Christmas and, er, that's about it. It's pretty simple in terms of story, but then most slasher films tend to be that way. I hear that much the major gore was cut in order to get it released - and it shows.\nI would imagine that almost everything contained within this film would be considered 'shocking' and 'revolutionary' in terms of on-screen scares, whereas today, it's just kind of tame.\nAs I say, there's not much gore. And there's not much that you haven't seen in a hundred similar movies. I suppose there's something to be got out of the story in trying to guess who the killer is (I confess, I never managed to see how it would eventually end).\nThe characters are likable enough - those who are meant to be. And there are a few 'red herrings' thrown in there for good measure. The police were suitably useless in their efforts in catching the killer, but then if they were competent the film's runtime would be about ten minutes.\n'Black Christmas' is worth a watch if you like competent slasher films - there's nothing here that's bad, but, after over forty years, there's nothing here that new either.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b23a,tt0071222,Black Christmas,Cinema-reviewer321,13 December 2023,7,"I have heard about this Christmas horror movie before, and I have been hearing people say that they love it or think it is an underrated horror movie; after watching the movie, I can agree that it is good and that it is a bit underrated. The movie Black Christmas (1974) is a creepy, disturbing, and mostly suspenseful horror movie that uses Christmas time in an investing way; plus, each girl in the sorority house has something happen to them, most of them having to deal with realistic problems, which makes it disturbing, not just because of a maniac killer being in the movie.\nThe girls in the sorority are going through their own problems, like one of them wanting an abortion despite her boyfriend not wanting that, but there is also a maniac killer in the attic of the sorority house with nobody knowing; it makes the movie disturbing with the real problems the characters are going through, but also it makes it creepy with the way some characters act and the killer in the house. Along with that, the characters are like teenagers doing what teenagers do, but they do act like adults surprisingly; making rational choices like calling the police or trying not to answer the phone because of the many creepy and weird calls they get.\nI like that we never see the killer's face because he is covered by shadows or hides in darkness the whole movie, while also giving us his point of view where we only see his hands and his shoes when walking around; most of the cinematography have long takes and camera pans around the house that works with the creepy tone. Though the movie is rated R, which is for language and frightening scenes, it is not that gory, but it has disturbing kills in the movie that are still effective and are executed in ways that fit the Christmas holiday.\nBlack Christmas (1974) is a Christmas horror film that is worth giving a watch, though it takes its time building up to a point where it gets creepier, it is a highly effective movie that will creep you out and disturb you from beginning to end. The acting is not bad, the cinematography is well done, the antagonist hiding in the house is creepy, and the Christmas vibe with the movie works well with the horror side of the plot; this movie is underrated and is worth watching at least once.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b23b,tt0071222,Black Christmas,baileygianninimoviebuff,11 December 2023,9,"Black Christmas (1974) is a horror and slasher film that I have seen over and over again ever since I was a teenager. It is written and directed by none-other than the talented filmmaker Bob Clark and it stars, Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon (from Wes Craven's original A Nightmare On Elm Street 1984) The film centers around a group of college aged women who are in a sorority house, and they get killed off by an unknown serial killer after and while he makes very disturbing obscene phone calls to the home, which is probably located near a university that they attend during the college school year. This is the best horror and slasher movie that is set during the Christmas holiday. The script is magnificently written, the dialogue provides very realistic conversations. If Olivia Hussey didn't get more movie roles after her performance in Black Christmas then I would really love to know why. All of the kills are very brutal in this film, and much like the original Halloween movie that John Carpenter would later write and direct in 1978, Black Christmas has the same technique of using violence that is implied rather being graphic and gory. Unlike the 2006 remake of this film, it's what you don't see and have to you use your imagination to imagine what the kills look like graphically that is terrifying and scary to anyone who watches this movie. Black Christmas (1974) is on my top five favorite horror movie classics, it's very much on par with Halloween (1978) and the only other horror movie that is on par with the original Halloween and the original Black Christmas is Scream (1996) . I love the cinematography and the camera use in this movie. Like how the camera glides from place to place at times, and the ending is very good. I'm very happy that Bob Clark didn't turn Black Christmas into a horror franchise like how the movie studios did with the Halloween franchise. The opening kill scene with the use of a white bag being placed over Claire's head and face to suffocate and kill her is super graphic for 1974, but now a days it is very tame compared to the graphic and explicit violence that we see nowadays in horror films. Even though Olivia Hussey did an amazing job at playing the role of Jessica Bard ford, I do wonder if Margot Kidder would've played that role a little bit better. But nonetheless, Black Christmas is an amazing classic horror movie of the 1970s that strongly recommend and suggest that all horror fans watch for the Christmas season if you're looking for a great classic horror film to watch. A very high thumbs up for me.\nWritten by\nBailey Giannini\n(movie buff and amateur film critic)",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

There are many elements of this movie that have been copied many times in other horror movies. ""Black Christmas"" does skip a bit now and then but it always manages to right its ship. It delivers quite a few solid thrills. The cast is filled with familiar faces. I did find the killer more than a bit annoying but all of his noise isn't a deal breaker. The same way as other horror movies of the 1970's, ""Black Christmas"" is not nearly as bloody as people think. It's scarier than bloody. This is probably not saying much but this might be director Bob Clark's best movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,

Jessica is a serority girl living in a house with about eleven others. Most go off for christmas break leaving the others in the house. Its a good group of characters left. I was for some reason expecting to see blood and I thought it would be more grahpic than it. Never the less though black christmas pulls through and becomes an enjoyable dark christmas slasher.

I am talking about the original 1974 movie.\nBlack Christmas was the first of its kind. It gave us the first holiday slasher that used the point of view of the killer. John Carpenter would then use the same thing in Halloween four years later. In Black Christmas, just like Halloween, using the perspective from the killer adds a creepiness to the movie and adds to the dread.\nThe actors, mostly woman, were really good. Margot Kidder, soon to be Lois from Superman fame, also four years later, was a real stand out as Barb with her sassiness. Olivia Hussey was also very good.\nThe plot was simple. A maniac is on the loose and ends up in the attic of the sorority house where the girls are living. Most of the girls go home for the holidays, but a few stay behind, and the killer picks them off one by one, calling the sorority house phone after each death. I will say no more, so as not to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen this. And once again, I am talking about the original 1974 film.\nI would definitely recommend this movie, but some incompetence on the part of the police force takes a point away. The camera work is well done and the sound effects used were just as good.\nThis movie was entirely creepy with a few jump scares to add to it. I loved the way distraction was used so that our protagonists never realize the horrible things happening not far away from them.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b49,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b23f,tt2582802,Whiplash,alycefabel,21 December 2023,8,"Have you ever wondered what a person's path should be to become great? Talent, hard work, a nudge from the outside? What should be the motivation to practice the same skill for hours, days, weeks, years in hopes of one day becoming the best?\nHonestly, I don't have answers to these questions. The very realization that I would have to practice the same thing on a regular basis over a long period of time throws me off. Constancy is clearly not my strong suit. Today I'm doing one thing, and tomorrow I'm burned out and doing something completely new. It's hard to master one skill perfectly under those circumstances, but you can try a lot of things. Maybe this is MY way - to try the world in all its diversity!\nHowever, Andrew Newman knows exactly what he wants - he wants to become the best drummer and is ready to wipe his hands in blood to realize his dream. One day his playing is noticed by the conductor of the best student orchestra in the country and he is invited to join the troupe. As stereotypical as geniuses are often portrayed in movies, Damien Chazelle's film portrays the conductor himself as stereotypical - overbearing, ruthless, manipulative, but a true creator and builder. Are you ready to endure anger, rage and emotional swings from a mentor who wants to awaken the great musician in you?\nAfter the tragic death of one of the conductor's previous students, an investigation begins into the teaching methods of Terence Fletcher (that's the conductor's name). At some point Andrew too breaks under the teacher's onslaught and it seems that the path to his dream is complete. So Andrew also decides to testify against his idol, after which the conductor is suspended from running the orchestra.\nThe story could have ended there, if not for the love of music. Some time later Terence invites Andrew to play the drum part at one of the festivals, which is important for the future of musicians - the jury members can give a ticket to life or close all roads to the professional world. Either out of a desire for revenge or intentionally manipulating Andrew's feelings once again, the conductor sets the drummer up and plays a part for which the drummer was unprepared, resulting in Andrew's public embarrassment. But instead of breaking down again, he takes the next beat into his own hands and already begins to lead the entire orchestra. In the end, Andrew and the conductor become so obsessed with the music and themselves that they produce something ""beyond human capabilities,"" as Movie Search says about it. Without irony, the final scene was indeed very musical and inspired.\nNevertheless, I have mixed impressions about this movie. Some bitter aftertaste because of the behavior of the main character and his mentor. Probably because such teaching methods are just not for me. But maybe that's why I won't become great, who knows.\nOn the other hand, the drum parts with absolutely frantic rhythm and the general atmosphere of the movie are mesmerizing and keep you in suspense throughout the whole picture. So, I think it's worth watching, to at least answer for yourself the question about your limits on the way to perfection.\n8 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b240,tt2582802,Whiplash,Official_Tunka,19 December 2023,9,"Wow, just wow. I'm sitting here, still catching my breath after watching ""Whiplash,"" and I can't help but feel like I've just been through an emotional whirlwind. Damien Chazelle's masterpiece is unlike anything I've seen before, a heart-pounding symphony of ambition and obsession that left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.\nFirst off, let's talk about Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman. I was completely blown away by his performance. The guy not only nailed the intense drumming sequences (seriously, my heart was racing during those scenes), but he also brought such depth to his character. You could feel Andrew's burning desire for greatness, and as the story unfolded, I found myself both rooting for him and fearing for his sanity.\nAnd J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher-wow, just wow. I can't imagine anyone else in that role. Simmons was a force of nature, this relentless, almost terrifying presence as the music instructor. Fletcher's teaching methods were borderline insane, but Simmons played him with such nuance that I found myself questioning whether his intensity was a necessary evil or just straight-up abuse of power. No wonder he bagged the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nThe whole atmosphere of the film was just electric. The drumming, the jazz, the tension-it all blended together in this perfect storm of emotions. The cinematography and the score elevated every moment, making even the smallest practice session feel like a life-or-death situation. The way Chazelle captured the competitive world of music conservatories was nothing short of genius.\nBut it's not just about the music; it's about the human cost of chasing perfection. The film had me contemplating the lengths one should go to achieve greatness. Is it worth sacrificing everything? The relationships, the health, the sanity? ""Whiplash"" doesn't shy away from these tough questions, and it left me pondering the blurred lines between motivation and abuse, success and obsession.\nThe dialogue was razor-sharp. I mean, I could quote lines from this movie all day. Each word felt like a punch, driving home the film's themes about the relentless pursuit of one's dreams. And the editing-oh, don't get me started. The tight shots during drumming sequences, the rapid editing during confrontations, it all added to the intensity. I was literally on the edge of my seat, hanging on every beat.\nIn the end, ""Whiplash"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It celebrates the pursuit of excellence while forcing you to confront the price of that pursuit. I'm still processing everything, but one thing's for sure: ""Whiplash"" has left an indelible mark on me. It's a cinematic gem that will stay with me for a long, long time. If you haven't seen it, buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Furthermore, the implication that a musician student would not react and stick up for themselves by handing Simmons his ass is a tired story. Everyone has a breaking point, everyone.

Again, the relationship of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a freshman and jewel of talent at the same school, with his teacher Fletcher, I claim to be one of the most stormy cinematic events of recent times. Of course, the most important factor that makes the narrative epic is the outstanding directorial performance of Damien Chazelle. The relationship of the hometown person with the Jazz world is at a certain point, but this cinematic event has really gone beyond jazz. It's even almost the kind that will make you love jazz. After a while while watching the movie, I officially likened the rehearsals in the movie to war scenes, and the musicians to veterans. It was a really successful movie. Finally, of course, J. K.

This film, featuring the intense journey of Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) and his tumultuous relationship with the formidable Fletcher (J. K.

As a viewer not deeply rooted in music, I found myself enthralled and engrossed, as if I were alongside Nieman, feeling every beat and enduring every challenge. The movie's pace and intensity had me watching in a stiff, tense state, mirroring the emotional rollercoaster experienced by Teller's character.\nWhat makes ""Whiplash"" truly stand out is its complex character dynamics, particularly the captivating presence of Fletcher. J. K. Simmons delivers a performance that is both enraging and enthralling, drawing viewers into a love-hate relationship with his character. His portrayal adds depth to the film, making the audience yearn for more of his compelling presence.\nDespite being a non-music aficionado, I found the film's portrayal of ambition, passion, and the pursuit of excellence universally relatable and deeply moving. The film's conclusion left me wishing for an extended cut, a testament to its captivating nature. I would have gladly indulged in a five-hour version of this intense, musical journey.\nIn conclusion, ""Whiplash"" is a remarkable film that resonates with viewers of all musical backgrounds. Its exceptional storytelling, coupled with powerful performances, creates an unforgettable experience. For its ability to engage, provoke, and inspire, I give it a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

First of all, much of it has very little to do with Christmas. The idea is that the inn is open and gives shows on holidays, which means that Christmas is just one of many shown. Second.... something about Bing Crosby's awww shucks nice guy performance seems inauthentic to me, especially in light of what I know about him. The female leads annoy me. One dumps Fred Astaire's character the minute some guy waves dollars at her. Then she comes crawling back to him and expects him to forget that she dumped him. Hardly a sympathetic character. The other one can't seem to make up her mind what she cares about. Does she really love either man? For that matter, does either one love her? The best Crosby can muster for her is a perfunctory peck on the cheek, and both of them respond with an ""oh well, whatever"" when she bounces from one to the other. It seems like they're more interested in competing than in love. Fred's dancing is the redeeming feature, especially the firecracker dance. Him dancing while ""drunk"" was silly, though.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b250,tt0034862,Holiday Inn,Sir-Final_Thoughts-No_Review,3 January 2023,7,"Irving Berlin's Holiday Inn. Its got the best A-list talent for a musical you could ask for in 1942. The immortal Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire still in the prime of a long and successful career, with wonderful supporting help from Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale who you couldn't do without. It also introduces the timeless christmas classic staple 'White Christmas' to the moviegoing audience for the first time (also the basis for the movie of the same name with Crosby a few years later). When it plays you'll absolutely revel in it, its calming and beautiful.\nHoliday Inn as a title is appropriate because that's the backdrop that takes center stage here. Crosby retired from a song and dance routine tries his hand at farming but finds being lazy (a great number!) and not having to work a much better idea and remodels the farm into an inn literally open only on holidays; including Washington's birthday, Lincoln's birthday, Independence Day and of course Christmas! And to his closest friends surprise its a sold out hit with packed crowds and the excuse to throw out some showstopping musical numbers.\nThe music the main highlight of the movie here and the singing and dancing is incredible and at times literally (!) explosive. My favorite tunes of course the previously mentioned 'White Christmas' and 'Lazy' and also 'Be Careful, Its My Heart'.\nThe story is a bit corny and is the weakness of Holiday Inn. Its spins a romantic web between all 4 main characters that's dizzier than a 1940s film noir. Trying to keep up and make sense of it will just leave you in a bind. But it has alot of heart and a good dose of comedy, my highlight the maid Mamie and her two children, adorable little boy and girl, its always a howl when they appear.\nAs far as controversy, you may already know it has a musical number involving 'Blackface' which of course for the time period was general practice. Banned on broadcast TV its obviously offensive but it doesn't hurt the film in any way in my opinion. Just understand to seek out a censored version if that's not your taste. Other than its a good christmas musical worth watching for White Christmas of course and the talents of Crosby & Astaire and a talented supporting cast. For fans of the musicals of Irving Berlin as well!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

I recently purchased a digital copy of Holiday Inn and was surprised to have to read a disclaimer before the show began about the racism in it and how that the racists attitudes had been left intact to document our racist past. That made me laugh because they hypocritically accepted my money to purchase the film while decrying how awful it was. What does that say about the provider?\nAnyway, I still love this show. It's beautifully shot and is perfect for setting a Christmas mood. Although the film flits from holiday to holiday, all the important moments happen at Christmas time. I like the symmetry of the movie. It opens and closes with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire dueling over winning a damsel's heart with singing vs winning with dancing. They're tied by the end of the film 1-1. Bing wins Linda Mason (Majorie Reynolds) with singing and Fred gets Lila (Virginia Dale) with dancing.\nThere's more than a few iconic moments; Bing singing ""White Christmas "" is the most famous. That song would hold numerous sales records for decades. It also became the namesake of the Holiday Inn hotel chain, of course. Fred Astaire's dancing is just amazing to watch. Marjory Reynolds was quite the hoofer too. I'm surprised she never became an A-list movie star. She had it all, looks, voice, dancing.\nAnyway I highly recommend this movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

But each thing was by different people and didn't mesh quite right with the others.\nIt felt like a messy dream, and maybe that's exactly what they were going for to make you feel like Elvis may have felt living it. But it's not enjoyable as a movie or as a story due to the format. They were trying to make it different and to modernize it, and to tell the story about Elvis while validating the black culture his music stemmed from. That part they did the best of anything. The bits of black culture they show is vibrant and energetic and inspirational. Definitely beats the white culture that's freaking out about some guy's pelvic jiggling. If that's how it really happened those white folk were pretty thirsty for a little sexiness.\nNormally I wouldn't say quite so much about a movie you maybe haven't seen yet, but I think going into it knowing all this would've made it better for me.\nI got 3/4 through it and I'm not going back to it, but I'm glad I watched as much as I did.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b25f,tt3704428,Elvis,graceclark-58642,1 January 2024,5,"To start with, I am NOT rating this movie as Meandering because of Austin Butler's performance. Austin Butler was excellent as Elvis. Of course no one is going to really replicate Elvis Presley, Austin Butler did pretty dang close even if he was a little bit goofy looking. Austin Butler's acting was great, Olivia Dejonge was a worthy Priscilla but I'm not really sure they had much chemistry on the screen though. I didn't really get emotional when Priscilla left Elvis in the movie. Perhaps if they had been given more time together, or if the movie was entirely about Priscilla and Elvis, I would feel differently about these two. The main focus was Elvis Presley and his devil of a manager, played by Tom Hanks.\nWhat makes this movie a big disappointment Firstly was the rapid, dizzying story pace and the jerk between present day when Tom Parker lays dying, to the past. Left me with a bit of a headache, watching. Someone thought that the producer might have ADHD, perhaps that is what happened. Because this type of pace isn't normal and I hated it instantly. Also, I had no idea who Tom Parker was so to open the movie with Tom Parker was a little jarring. Would have been more practical if they opened it up with Elvis's death. Or funeral.\nSecondly, it's not often I agree with other critics but in the case of Tom Hanks' , the ridicule is completely justified. Tom Hanks' sounds like a fool with his abhorrent, fake German accent? That grated on my ears! And why did he even have to narrate the movie, when the audience is led to hate him throughout the movie? Why couldn't they have just told the story? I didn't think a narrator was needed. Especially not him! Seriously, in a movie about the King of Rock, Tom Parker's ugly voice was not needed.\nThirdly, Elvis Presley deserved a slower, more respectful pacing in his own movie. About his own life. It felt like they were constantly trying to hurry you on to the next phase of his life and didn't even give you a chance to really empathize, and absorb the life and world of Elvis. You see way too much of Tom Parker, to the point where you want to tear him out of the film, because the movie shouldn't even be about him. It should be about Elvis.\nThen there's the ending itself. Just cutting off after Elvis awesomely fires Tom Parker and then to explain through scrolling the rest of history. After all of the drama of revealing what a con artist and what a Mephistopheles-like demon Tom Parker was; worming his way into Elvis Presley's life and leading him to absolute misery...\nWhy didn't the writers give us satisfaction of a scene of Tom Parker dying alone in the hospital? You tell such a heart-wrenching tale of all that happened Presley, it was a mistake that all we are left with at the end was just a couple history cards to read.\nI have seen better biopics from Hollywood. This is not one of them. I expected a lot more of the story of Elvis Presley. Johnny Cash and June Carter got a pretty good Hollywood movie, Elvis Presley deserved better than this.\nGuess I would say to the fans of the King, watch it for free and don't be surprised if you end up disappointed.

The short cuts, the surrealistic feel, lots going on at once, fast pans from one thing to the next, the split screens, the non-linearity , etc, --- I believe these are all Luhrmann hallmarks. I appreciate the effort it took to make such a glitzy, lush display. The film has a high production value. Obviously Luhrmann had a huge budget for this project and spared no expense. Butler did an outstanding job in the title role, as did the young man who played the pre-teen Elvis. It is hard for me to be objective about Tom Hanks' performance, because I had read too many scathing reviews of it. If anyone else had played the role of Colonel Parker, I don't think his reviews would have been nearly as bad. It's just hard to watch an iconic talent play a caricature. Plus the character was creepy in all those grotesque circus and carny scenes, and his prosthetics were distracting. The soundtrack had a lot of overlays of one bit of music over another; a stylistic choice which did not satisfy me. You will guess my age when I tell you that I owned a pink plastic Elvis Presley wallet when I was a little girl. So maybe I was not this film's intended audience.

This is not the tribute I wished it had been to such an incredible artist. There needs to be a true movie made about Elvis that doesn't have Persilla's biased views on him and his life. Yes, she played a huge role in his life but her view isn't always the greatest! Maybe a movie with his band mates view on him might be more entertaining?

Ok, a narrative choice, I have absolutely no problem with it. Tom Hanks make a good job out of it.\nLet's start with the good parts:\nThe time characterization was on point in terms of wardrobes and environments. The settings look beautiful and are believable to feature in 1950's Southern USA.\nTom Hanks is a very good Colonel Parker and could have carried the movie as its de facto protagonist if it had a good narrative.\nThe Elvis casting was on point. Elvis looks like Elvis and also behaves like Elvis. I don't know if the songs were re-recorded, but if they were, the job was very well done.\nElvis's mother is very well cast as well. The character is believable as an overprotective provincian mother who is the biggest fan of her superstar son.\nAnd that's it. Just so I don't get accused of having ill-will towards the movie.\nNow, let's review the bad.\nElvis's father is given no chance of ever becoming more than a prop. The real Vernon Presley was a small time criminal who would deserve at least one scene exposing his character, which was denied, although the fact the father was absent was mentioned during the film. Which brings the first very big problem with this movie: the constant telling, not showing. Many important moments are either implied or just mentioned instead of being acted out and shown on screen. The Colonel approaching Elvis is implied. The negotiation between the Colonel and the Sun Records executives is mentioned. The past dishonesty of the Colonel is implied. The moment when the Colonel wants to seduce Elvis on how much of a big star he could be is extremely lazy and takes 3 minutes at most, missing an opportunity to describe on screen how manipulative and persuasive the Colonel could be. And many, many, many such instances, many missed opportunities to fill a 150 minute movie with meaningful, fluent narrative. It is a movie made for and by people who fried their attention spans on social media.\nThe movie also (of course, we are in the 2020s) does not miss the opportunity on lecturing the audience on still existing social issues. Don't get me wrong, the Elvis Presley story could have been a good vehicle for this kind of messaging, as his zenith was during Jim Crow and his white skin certainly helped him market black music in that era. But, of course, nothing is ever developed, no black character is deeper than a plate, no prominent black musicians of the time are properly shown (BB King is acknowledged and waves at Elvis from a window, so the producers can show you that they know the reference). Blacks are no individuals but a collective prop, like most other characters. This gets a lot of focus and screen time, without ever getting any development. Mechanical, shallow narratives make for a good pair with empty virtue signaling, and this film is no different.\nThe final nail in the coffin, the red marker that shows the people responsible don't suffer only of inability to make a proper movie but of a complete lack of common sense and good taste was the completely inappropriate shoveling of amorphic, corporate and soulless current songs into this movie. Fast-food soundtracks are meant to get the customers to leave as soon as possible, they have absolutely no reason to feature in an Elvis movie. An Elvis movie, an icon of popular music of all characters. In the first instance of this I felt taunted by the filmmakers and legitimately angry. In the second I noticed that this would be a common theme, and it certainly matches the narrative blandness and the unjustified high opinion the filmmakers have of their own morals and intellect, but it certainly does not match an Elvis movie. AN ELVIS MOVIE, WHAT DO TIKTOK SONGS HAVE TO DO WITH IT? HOW IS THIS APPROPRIATE? WHAT IS THE AESTHETICAL OR ATMOSPHERICAL GAIN? The third instance I finally don't know if it existed as I could not waste my precious Sunday anymore on this unforgiving, aggressively nonsensical movie.\nThis movie is nothing but a big missed opportunity. Go watch the actual Elvis films if you want entertainment, or 'The Green Book' if you want a competent reconstruction of Jim Crow USA.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

I'll admit it's hard. First of all Austin Butler was great. I was born is 92 he's born in 91 I'm very excited for future cinema from this talent. He was not the problem with this film not by any means. Camera work, quality of picture. Even the sound wasn't great which come on? That's the most important part. I always thought Tom Hanks was over rated but this was the first time I thought he was a bad actor. Story telling was weak. I mean to be fair to everyone I'm not sure Elvis deserved a movie in the sense of a story goes. One of the most talented and influential people to ever step foot on planet earth but there was nothing we needed to see that we didn't know. He was about talent. Sure he didn't have it easy.

The only real problem I had with this movie is that some of the scenes felt a bit dragged out and its 130 minute runtime could definitely have been shortened down a bit.\nBut calling this movie uninspiring is crazy. This was both an inspiring movie about the struggles of both black and white men in 1960a America and also a heartwarming story of two dudes bonding over music. Both mahershala Ali and Virgo mortenson gave A grade preformances.

At first I thought this to be the usual super-pedagogical anti-racist ""movie with a message"", which I hate because the message is mostly too obvious and in your face, trying to lecture the viewer. However, this one is different. Both protagonists have their fairly distributed faults, strengths and weaknesses. None of them is solely victim or perpetrator. The differences between them are multi-faceted, not only between black/white, but also between rich/poor, homo/hetero, intellectual/down to earth, arrogant/likable, lonely guy/family man. The narrow-mindedness of institutionalized racism is clearly demonstrated.\nBoth actors do a fine job, the male bonding between this two contradictory characters is quite believable. It works fine as an entertaining road movie, albeit the ending reminded me a bit too strongly of Planes, Trains and Automobiles.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b269,tt6966692,Green Book,goodemma1,21 December 2023,9,"""Green Book"" is a remarkable film that embarks on a journey not only through the deep south of America but also through the complexities of human relationships and societal prejudices. Directed masterfully by Peter Farrelly, the movie is a blend of humor, drama, and a poignant exploration of racial dynamics in the 1960s.\nViggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver exceptional performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. Mortensen, as Tony Lip, embodies the rough-around-the-edges bouncer with a heart of gold, while Ali, portraying Dr. Don Shirley, brings an air of elegance and dignity, masking his character's inner struggles with societal constraints and loneliness.\nThe chemistry between the two leads is the heartbeat of the film, evolving from mere employer-employee relationship to a genuine, deep-seated friendship. It's this evolving bond that forms the core of the narrative, making every shared laugh, disagreement, and moment of mutual support something special.\nThe screenplay is another highlight, offering a balanced mix of humor and seriousness without delving into cliches. The film tactfully addresses issues of racism and segregation, without losing its warmth and charm. Its depiction of the era is both eye-opening and thought-provoking, offering a window into a not-so-distant past.\nWhat makes ""Green Book"" stand out is its ability to tackle serious issues while maintaining an uplifting tone. It's a story about breaking down barriers, understanding and valuing differences, and the power of human connection. This film doesn't just entertain; it enlightens and inspires.\nThe direction, acting, script, and the incredible soundtrack all contribute to making ""Green Book"" a memorable film. Its message of love, respect, and friendship resonates long after the credits roll. This is a movie that deserves all the accolades it has received and is definitely worth a watch.\nIn summary, ""Green Book"" is a beautifully crafted film that offers more than just entertainment. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in a world divided by differences. A solid 9 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

And yes, you should definitely put it on.\nRight off the bat, this is not a tearjerker nor a moralistic film at all. In fact it's a film that just shows you what it is, as a sophisticated black piano player with a lot of courage drives from show to show in the deep white South, backed by his hard-as-nails Italian driver.\nIt's a very welcome way of portraying heartbreaking practices in society, keeping its focus on the good we have inside, especially between these two unlikely friends. It pulls a trick to achieve this, deliberately skipping the hard moments and only showing the aftermaths, stripping it from too much drama.\nThe camera just never loses sight of either of our friends, and that makes it an exceptionally good film.

Alongside the driver, who is more of a who-cares man, and the contrast between these two is showed very good, very clearly, and it was fun watching it. Green Book is taking up important genres. Family, racism and acceptation. The movie is settled back in the old time America were the blacks rights were better, but still on a low quality. Including the important things they talk about, it was very funny, too. The jokes were fun and intelligent, and they included some very nice ironic sentences. The story is very holding, it is almost like reading a book, with different chapters. Every chapter, was one city where the duo was on a concert. And they were driving and driving, and sooner you got longer into things, you are getting more about The Pianist and his backstory, and why he is so uptight and serious all the time. About the technicals. The pictures and scenography did really the job with some retro atmosphere, as well as some good songs, including some very old symphonies too, that is definitely a fun thing to listen for musicians. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both great and put power into their role, and they did their job great! Concluding everything, Green Book is more than just a green book, it is a story of two different persons that meet each other, with a completely misunderstanding, but later on, they show how you can be a good person and that you must open yourself to show who you really are.

The plot reminded me of the Beatles' movie ""Yellow Submarine"", wherein a happy, colorful place gets overrun by a group of beings who turn it into a miserable, colorless place (obviously in this movie there are no Beatles to come to the rescue).\nThe songs - including an Academy Award-nominated one - didn't really catch my attention. With most movies I tend to focus on the plot, even if it's a children's movie. I will say that the movie has some splendiferous animation.\nLast but not least, I of course have to mention the cast. The combination of Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Christine Baranski, James Corden, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kunal Nayyar, Russell Brand, Gwen Stefani and Quvenzhané Wallis makes this movie a link between *NSYNC, ""Into the Woods"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""The Big Bang Theory"", political comedy, No Doubt and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"".\nAnyway, it's an enjoyable movie.

The actual plot centres around the peaceable trolls who must flee their home when the menacing ""Bergen"" arrive bent on eating them all for a ""trollstice"" treat.

This will probably play well to very young children - there are lots of vibrant colours, a few songs to liven things up and just a hint of ""Janet and John"" moralising about what truly matters in life.

If otherworldly creatures belting out pop hits makes you nervous (perhaps you're still flashing back on Strange Magic, shudder to think), you might find yourself nonplussed in the theater. These songs, it turns out, are the best parts of the movie. It's everything else that's wrong.\nThe Trolls, based on the dolls with the hair, live carefree in a blissful, wooded community, having years hence escaped lives of captivity under the rule of the giant, grumpy Bergens. When they are again discovered and a (literal) handful of them are taken, Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick) teams up with Bergen expert and sullen outcast Branch (Justin Timberlake) to mount a rescue mission.\nTrolls' attempts at humor are like the last ten years' worth of sitcoms copied down to the umpteenth generation until the jokes have become thin and hollow echoes. Jokes, in fact, is too strong a word. In place of humor or comedic characters, our protagonists affect a sort of weary smarm, reacting to one another with long pauses and stares or with a curt, dismissive, ""That's weird."" Perhaps that's preferable, though, to the Trolls' other mode, which panders to the young audience of a few years ago, when the movie was likely written, by having characters shout things like ""OMG!"" or, most embarrassingly, ""YOLO!""\nHowever, when this patience-trying dialogue goes away for a few minutes, a seemingly entirely different film emerges. The musical numbers (as well as the occasional action or chase sequence) are whimsical, unpredictable delights. Poppy's journey to Bergentown, for instance, is told over the course of a single song but in a montage that gives us a tour of the varied and interesting locales of this fantasy realm. Most of these dreamy song segments remove us from the physical world of the film, inventively employing a felt and paper visual motif that recalls Poppy's scrapbooking hobby.\nPoppy's arts and crafts are just a taste of the many pleasures the Trolls find in their world. Bergens, on the other hand, can only feel happy by eating Trolls, or so we're told. Eventually, we arrive at the thematic point of the film, wherein we learn that happiness is not something you put inside yourself. It's already there and you just need to bring it out. It's a surprisingly and unconvincingly anti-consumerist message for a movie based on toys.\nTrolls might be worth a dollar or two at the Redbox where you can just skip ahead to the music and action vignettes that bring it to life. When it comes to characters, story and personality, though, the movie's as thin as a wisp of brightly colored hair.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

She is about to make another breakthrough with her career as she's about to record her symphony but everything seems to work not in her favour. As she battles with her relationship with her wife, the accusations made from the suicide of Krista, the legal battles as the accusations of sexual exploitation, and overall the downfall of her career as she battles her trouble causing emotions too.\nThis movie shows us that it is never good to bite more than you can chew. The hierarchy of power in any setting can have serious impact on anything, in other words, sexual exploitation. It's the impact todays society has on the world today with 'cancel culture'.\nThe story is beautifully constructed and it's ability to switch from one scene straight to the next is something remarkable I feel most filmmakers don't have the guts to do. The construct of Tár's character and it's development is amazing and gradually perfect. The development of the story is great and the turning points are plotted in just when you think all is well.\nThe cinematography is so subtly done it works wonders to the eye because whilst it doesn't seem to be very cinematic you can tell it is still all in the shot despite there not being dynamic colours to express emotion or very specific camera movements. The long shots taking place between conversations is remarkable and represent the stableness in Tár's career and how later the scenes are a bit more complexly edited and chopped up representing the unstableness of Tár's career is amazing.\nCate Blanchett played this role terrifically, the screenplay must've been written for her as she literally is Tár and encapsulates everything Tár is meant to be and feel to an awe.\nTodd Field really went all out with this film. His choice of subtle camera movement is great but what's most important is how he works around with the actors, the sets, and all else.\nThe ending of this film has left me in absolute brilliance as it perfectly encapsulates todays society especially in the last shot/reveal.\nTár has done the impossible and has added 'Gen-Z' into an absolutely terrific film without ruining it but instead making the best use out of it and even using it for the plot. Even using it to truly represent the downfall and what Tár's career has come to.\nThis film deserves further analysis and re-watches as of how brilliant the film really is.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

I'm just so curious who is this film meant for? It's very pretentious and goes very into very detailed conversations about classical music, but in a shallow and unrealistic way. I also would've expected that the music would be a big part of the storyline, however from the beginning you're greeted with a soundtrack that I can only describe as nails on a chalkboard.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

It's a film that demands your full attention, unfolding at a pace that is not slow but meticulously measured. For those willing to immerse themselves in its narrative, the movie offers a rich and enjoyable experience.\nThe storyline is a compelling exploration of the complex interplay between immense talent and the pursuit of success. Lydia Tár, portrayed with exceptional nuance, navigates the high stakes world of classical music. The film masterfully illustrates how subtle manipulations can spiral into profound consequences, presenting a narrative both contemporary and timeless.\nThis isn't just a film; it's an experience that lingers with you, challenging perceptions of power dynamics in creative fields. With a rating of 8 out of 10, ""Tár"" is undeniably a must-see. It's a testament to the power of cinema to both entertain and provoke thought, leaving an indelible mark on its audience.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b27f,tt14444726,Tár,ryanpersaud-59415,6 November 2023,7,"I watched Tár over the course of a few hours, frequently pausing the film and watching something else, then coming back to it. Or taking a nap. I don't think calling this movie boring is that controversial; the first 40 minutes of the film are deliberately difficult, an excruciatingly long interview opens the film and it's follow quickly by a dinner conversation that goes on for way too long.\nTo say Tár did not need to be 2 hrs and 37 minutes long would be beating a dead horse. Of course it didn't need to be. It is beause it reflects the sort of pretentious, grandiose person Lydia Tár is. Tár, at its core, is a character study and a parable about modern times; a film about cancel culture and the accountability of cultural icons.\nCate Blanchett truly disappears into this role and delivers a powerhouse performance here. It's hard not to sound like a broken record, but she really becomes Lydia. There's an amazing physicality to her performance along with her incredible affectations and ability to portray Tár consistently, even whilst speaking different languages.\nI also found the film's sometimes meandering pace to be compelling as it gave us a chance to get to know people without necessarily figuring out where they all fit in Tár's life. It really made the film feel like a slice of life, where the story has a lot of context before the movie begins, and will go on after (naturally, given the ending).\nIt's also a very well made film; the cinematography and sound design, thankfully, are impeccable. You really get sucked into whatever room you're in and there's an overbearing sense of atmosphere, a coldness associated with the refined world of classical music.\nYet, this is also a movie I'd probably never watch again. It does a lot quite well, but is too simple a plot to waste so much time. Most of the other um...non, Tár characters, are pretty paper thin and we don't really have any particular subplots or complex relationship dynamics. As the movie lurches towards its end, I felt like it implies a strong emotional connection to what's happening, but it never really made it.\nThis is a story that could've been told in a very conventional, straightforward way, but it's smarter than that. It takes a pretty nuanced and difficult-to-discuss subject and tackles it head on, but in a way that feels as if it's an aspect of the character's life and not the whole thing. Tár, like many Oscar bait films, has a lot to appreciate. But, I genuinely don't believe it's the sort of film many people will honestly remember and appreciate years down the road.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

At some points, I felt as though I was watching excerpts from Robert Greenberg's educational videos on the history of music (The Great Courses). In fact, some of the anecdotes relayed in this film were familiar to me only because of my prior exposure to the erudite Mr. Greenberg's massive oeuvre.\nLots of reviewers are comparing this creation to Whiplash, and there is something to that comparison, but mainly the story revolves around a person who seems more concerned with her own status than anything else. Others see reflections of Black Swan. I agree that there are overlaps, but this is not a copycat film.\nThe film is beautifully shot and contentful enough not to be boring--but only if you are a part of the world of art music. Otherwise, I imagine that it would be very tedious to get through. I rather liked the ambiguous ending, which seems to be a trend, judging by the other new movies I have watched of late.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Especially by Cate Blanchett for convincing me of every emotion her character is feeling, and of the rightness of it. And for saying and doing the things I would have done, and have done in my life. I think this is called identification with the main character of a book or play or movie. The main reason we enjoy it.\nObviously it is not all her work. Todd Field wrote and directed the movie. And in making the movie, he went to the greatest amount of trouble. The musicians are real musicians. Sophie Kauer is a real cellist, not an actress. Cate Blanchett plays the piano herself. The orchestra and its performance of Mahler's Fifth Symphony are real and breathtaking. There are no tricks. This is a movie to satisfy the lover of classical music. The music does not come second.\nWe are allowed a look into the life and personality of a very talented and powerful person. With the pathologies that such a talent could bring. This is recognized and used by those around her. As Lydia herself would say:\n""Put the art before the artist"".\nThis is a movie that we should watch and re-watch until we understand it. It is NOT an 'art film'. There are no secret depths to it, or symbolic meanings. It is a movie from which each of us can learn about ourselves. Full Marks to Todd Field.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b283,tt14444726,Tár,eoreill,31 October 2023,8,"Tár portrays a gifted conductor and composer at the summit of her career who soon finds herself at the center of a media scandal. Its protagonist, Lydia Tár, is brilliantly portrayed by Cate Blanchett, who deftly communicates Tár's fierce intelligence and credibly conveys her emotions as she slips ever deeper into a downward spiral. When she talks about music, she really does seem to know what she's talking about (at least to someone who is not a trained classical musician). And when she goes over the edge it is explosive.\nThe film builds towards this explosion slowly and steadily, gradually creating an atmosphere of growing unease through a succession of seemingly minor incidents, striking images, and disquieting music. When the tension finally crests and breaks in Tár's climax, it feels natural and inevitable. The film's taught two-and-a-half-hours-plus are well-used.\nThe scandal, or rather the combination of scandals, that take Tár down will feel familiar to anyone who has followed current events in the #MeToo era. I found the film's depiction of these events to be intelligent and believable. It did not oversimplify the issues addressed in order to score easy points among partisans of one point of view or another, a welcome change from many recent films that have often felt like they were pounding home their political message with a sledgehammer.\nTár's intelligence, production, and great acting show that there are still smart films being made in the 2020s. It received plenty of accolades, but probably deserved more awards.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b284,tt14444726,Tár,Pjtaylor-96-138044,28 October 2023,5,"It takes ages for the main plot of 'Tár (2022)' to become properly apparent, and any hint towards its true nature that occur prior to this are only really relevant in retrospect. For a long time, it feels a little aimless, a slice of life drama focusing on a renowned composer and her efforts to craft her latest concert. Slowly but surely, hints of her potential bad behaviour start to creep into the piece. There are quite a few red flags that pop up here and there, all of which soon point to something far more tangibly sinister than the protagonist's early dismissal of woke culture. By the time that you start to truly put together what's going on, though, it's almost time for the flick to finish. This means that there isn't really enough time to explore the fallout of the lead's unraveling; it would perhaps have been better if a lot of the early runtime was repurposed to showcase the aftermath of the movie's most major plot point. For a long time, the affair is just a bit dull, despite being well-made in almost every aspect. The lead performance is notably good, the direction is confident and the cinematography is beautiful in its own unassuming way. The screenplay, however, doesn't do enough to keep you engaged and it often gets lost in the intricacies of its subject matter, which may compel people interested in orchestral conducting but is likely to go over everyone else's heads. Some elements initially seem like odd inclusions but eventually reveal themselves to have been fairly clever visualisations of some later revelations, including some fleeting yet distinctly unsettling imagery that gets under your skin long before you know why it ought to have. Even these aspects don't save the piece from its slow, uneven pacing and its slightly dodgy politics. Its last few sequences feel kind of racist, in a way, and the whole piece feels as though it's pretentiously positioned against cancel culture (without even really diving into it properly - again, thanks to the strange structure that sees the most major plot element occur far too late to have any true impact). Pretentious is a good word for the whole thing, really; it sort of insists upon itself. It also seems to not want to be viewed politically while making choices that can't be seen as anything other than political, which is annoying. It's a technically solid film that's let down by its uneven and slow-paced narrative. It's not exactly bad, but I can't say I particularly enjoy all that much of it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

I'm watching an old 80's flick about a form of dancing, (came out in '84, figure it out) and while this wasn't what would be considered a great movie, boy, was it memorable. Because it had moments in it that you'll always remember, and I know it wasn't just me because I've read reviews here that have said the same thing. My point is, while many older movies didn't have the greatest or most believable plot, they were ENTERTAINING. They made memories with you. They found a way to tug on your heartstrings somehow. Many of these movies made in the last 10 years or so, they just can't pull that off. No matter how great the editing, cinematography, lighting, WHATEVER. And this is coming from someone who worked in that world and has a ton of respect for it, so I'm not bashing what Hollywood is about. I'm just bashing the level of quality it has fallen to.\nThis movie was just a snoozer. Made me appreciate La La Land that much more. Whatever made that movie click, this movie didn't have it. Acting was fine, and Gaga is easy on the eyes, but...not much more. It couldn't make me care, not for one moment.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

The movie's impressive set design and passionately acted extras showcase the brutal sufferings of innocent lives in a powerful and purposeful way without resorting to cheap thrills for the audience.\nWladyslaw Szpilman was not a hero or a fighter but a survivor whose salvation depended solely on luck. The film's believability and realism stem from its ability to convey this truth. Although the movie can be emotionally draining and heartbreaking, it is worth the sacrifice.

The movie shows what doesn't tell us anything. It shows that children,people are mercilessly slaughtered for no reason just because they are Jews. And those who do this job enjoy it.

But it is not absent in our human values, pity ,compassion, we all have such feelings.\nThe film is taken from a real event.. The main character is based on the Pianist book written by Szpilman. In this regard, many of the events experienced and shown have been handled first-hand.\nI watched the first hour of the movie with my mouth open.

Suspenseful, I'd say slightly moving and simply gripping. In my eyes, this is an amazing film. I think it's a great choice for war movie fans, but don't expect an action movie.

""The Pianist"" is a hard watch, it's a man's journey to survival. It's a man's personal history of how he survived the Holocaust. It's not the typical holocaust movie. ""The Pianist"" sheds a very important light on the atrocities happening outside of the Jewish ghetto and outside of the concentration camps. Many atrocities and many monstrosities continued to happen every day outside of all these places. Strong images, great craftsmanship from Polanski. A very expressive Adrien Brody in the pinacle of his career. Very powerful, poetic scenes, my favourite being the piano scene by the end of the movie.

We don't know if our main character is going to live to see tomorrow, even as his comrade who helps him escape is shot in the head before his eyes. We hold the heavy, emotional burden of the Holocaust as we watch this, knowing what's happening all around Poland and Europe. And what's particularly unique about this film is it actually starts out very colorful, but as the film and story progresses, the color is slowly drained from the scenes. This is an excellent use of coloring in cinema in order build character and story, to show decay.\nIt's also music that saves this man's life, which is so symbolic for so many artists throughout the world. Without our art, we could not live to see tomorrow. But in this one man's story, it quite literally saves his life, for his piano-skills is what impresses the Nazi officer who feeds and hides him.

As the only hearing member of a deaf family we find out that she's spent a lot of her life since an early age having to translate and interrupt for her family when their out and about. Perhaps unfairly they've come to heavily rely on her whether at work or elsewhere. Things change though when she's motivated to join a school choir which takes her off in a whole new direction. She's actually a good singer though shy and awkward. The acting is actually really good, the slouched posture, downcast head and grungy clothes all convey this sense of awkwardness and fatigue. It's hinted that she's not had much time in her life to play and be free when growing up, she also struggles to connect with her mother who mistrusts their outside community. The film packs quite a punch and there's also an interesting subplot about difficulties with the family's fishing business and their fight against the big man who's pretty soon going to put them out of business. The film wonderfully captures the sense of warmth and also awkwardness in families, the way parents embarrass their children, the way children can embarrass their parents. The conflict though between dreams of a music scholarship and staying behind to help her parents becomes the central conflict of the film. Another interesting character is a passionate music teacher who devotes time to our lead character to help her follow her dreams. The music, lighting, editing are all great without ever becoming distracting or taking away from the performances or story. I feel that's really their proper function and too many filmmakers have forgotten that and made the characters and story come second too often. The story is set squarely in a film town and it's not until the very end that we finally find ourselves in a big city. The film has it's share of tropes, crowd pleasing moments and so on but there's a freshness and rawness to it that means you don't really mind actually. It's largely down to our main character who comes across as attractive, likeable, shy and just very natural and real. The film while largely about music is not afraid to use silence too to give us the other perspective. It also subtly explores the ways in which deaf people are often excluded from being able to do basic things. The love story is also very sweet in a simple uncynical kind of way.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Ruby is torn between her love of music and her family's dependence on her as a connection to the outside world.\nAlthough the story is somewhat predictable and formulaic, director Sian Heder manages to pull this film off effectively with a lot of heart. First and foremost, the family dynamic is heartwarming, played terrific by Emilia Jones, in quite a great voice, Marlee Matlin and Daniel Durant. The father, played by Troy Kotsur, absolutely enthralled me and provided some hilarious moments.\nThe director's sensitivity is also striking, allowing the drama to take its time while giving it momentum.

I knew Ansel Egort's ""Baby"" was a, well, driver, and I knew that Kevin Spacey (Doc) was his mentor. Perhaps unfairly, I assumed the film was a lot of action and not a lot of heart.\nAnd, funnily enough, the opening scene did very little to change that base assumption. The scene was incredible, mind you - with Baby and a group of robbers (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez) escaping the police in one of the most unique, thrilling, and pulse-pounding scenes I've seen in a LONG time - and I thought my previous prediction of how the rest of the film was going to play out was spot on.\nNot the case.\nInstead, ""Baby Driver"" flips the script on the viewer following the opening scene, diving much more into the protagonist, Baby, and his blossoming relationship with a lovely waitress (Lily James's Debora) then pedal to the metal action. The driving scenes are still there (and engaging, I might add), but this shockingly turns into an unexpected love story, especially during the second act.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with this, as Egort and James have fine chemistry and are unique characters, but issues start to arise when Wright tries to seamlessly blend this world with Baby's more hardened, violent world of crime. It is understood by us, the viewer, that this juxtaposition of worlds is the crux of the drama in the film, and that's fine, but the characters simply aren't refined enough - and the dialogue not strong enough - to really make us care about our Bonnie and Clyde-esque heroes.\nThe final result, a heart-pounding first half followed by an emotionally dull latter half, is amplified by fantastic performances from the aforementioned Egort, Jamie Foxx as the sparkplug ""Bats,"" and the terrific Jon Hamm as the engaging ""Buddy"". I would be remiss not to mention Eliza Gonzalez consistently stealing scenes as the sensual sharpshooter, ""Darling,"" as well.\nThe film shines in its unique sound-mixing and stellar soundtrack, both lauded by critics upon the film's release. These two elements are great, there is no question, but not enough to make up for a few of the gaffes previously mentioned.\nIt boils down to this: ""Baby Driver"" is fun, engaging, and unique; all important elements in making a fantastic picture. Unfortunately, Edgar Wright seemingly says all he has to say in the first twenty-five minutes of the film. After that, it is less heart and more tired formula. A good film that had the potential to be great.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2af,tt3890160,Baby Driver,frankde-jong,5 December 2023,8,"The story of ""Baby driver"" is a rather confentional crime story. The main character wants to make a big splash, pay off his debt and leave the criminal scene with his girl friend.\nSomething special is the fact that the main character is not a member of the criminal gang but their getaway driver. Unknown to me this seems to be a sort of sub genre of the crime movies with films such as ""The driver"" (1978, Walter Hill) and ""Drive"" (2011, Nicolas Winding Refn).\nReally special about the movie is the way the movements of the main character are in sync with the music he listens to. In his time Federico Fellini (for example in ""Otto e mezzo"", 1963) had music on the set to make the movements of the actors more rhythmic. This music was however not a part of the soundtrack as it is in ""Baby driver"".\nThe main character is a modern guy in every way and wears little earphones. The soundtrack / music he listens to is however predominantly 70's. The title of the film seems to be inspired by a Simon and Garfunkel song and the flight the main character has in mind with his girlfriend resembles in some ways the ending of ""The graduate"" (1967, Mike Nichols), also a film with Simon and Garfunkel music in it.\nA few years before ""Baby driver"" (2017) there were a couple of films in which modern devices had a big influence on the lives of the main characters. I am thinking of ""Her"" (2013, Spike Jonze) and ""Ex machina"" (2014, Alex Garland). In this respect the earphones in ""Baby driver"" seem just a minor gadget, but I think this is an underestimation. The earphones enable the main character to keep the real world outside. This way he never has the feeling to belong to a criminal gang, he just facilitates them.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2b0,tt3890160,Baby Driver,Movie_Beta,27 October 2023,8,"Baby Driver has to take credit for being one of the few original mainstream action movies in many a year.\nIt's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously with some great jokes thrown in, but importantly the action does not take a back seat at all. We get some of the best car chases in recent cinema and an extended foot chase that keeps you gripped and breathless all the way.\nIt is the music and editing that makes this movie wonderful, the soundtrack is all fitted into and incorporated into the visuals of the film. We see all sorts of movements and interactions by the actors and also the surrounding environment which is just genius. A quick example on the street is we hear someone at an ATM inputting their PIN and the key tone matching the soundtrack as the actor passes by briefly. There are loads of small details like this that only get spotted in repeated watches and make it a very rewarding watch.\nAnsel Elgort deserves praise for his lead as Baby, a role that has him dancing as well as running and driving. It's no exaggeration to call this movie an action-musical and it stands out for its originality and a great break out performance for him inparticular.\nSome parts are a little cheesy and look too polished, an example being the police cars that chase in a very choreographed formation (though maybe this is part of the 'dance'!). But these are far outweighed by the value we receive and the surprising depth of detail throughout.\nWell worth a watch for its originality alone.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Even if you can't put it to words, you watch a scene you can feel Wright's style oozing from every frame. That is the first thing viewers will notice in this film is its style.

(Bats in general was one of the better characters, his scenes are good because he seems genuinely crazy and it gives tension).\nThe love interest was done quite well, although I think a lot of that is that the girl is really attractive and likeable. They don't actually do that much together romantically, which is a mistake to getting the viewer involved.\nIt feels like it was a little bit inspired by ""True Romance (1993)"" for the romance and their plan, which was similarly an likeable and fun girl.

I love Jamie Foxx being annoyingly nuts, and John Ham and Eiza being all crazy Bonnie and Clyde.

Baby Driver refers to the main character of the film called Baby (not her off Dirty Dancing). A young adult (Ansel Elgort) who is great at spectacular getaway chases that owe more to the Fast and Furious kind of film.\nBaby wears earphones constantly and listens to music from his i-pod to drown out tinnutis in his ear/s brought on by a car accident in his childhood. A car accident that killed his mum and still haunts him. Baby (works) for a crime lord called Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Spacey's casting evoked memories of The Usual Suspects. Doc also uses a variety of criminals for his heists. Criminals with stupid nicknames!\nBaby begins to question his life of crime when he falls in love with a waitress at the local diner. For me evoking memories of The Wolf of Wall Street! The soundtrack is like one of those greatest hits compilations that you see advertised for Father's Day. Featuring the likes of Queen with their lesser known number Brighton Rock. The film has a Drive (the Ryan Gosling film) kind of polish to it. I nearly got mixed up with the comparisons!,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) is the man behind this creative take on Walter Hill's The Driver from 1978, and Wright's directorial style works well to complement the basic premise. Unfortunately, the film's script isn't equally strong or creative, which means that once the music stops, our interest drops. But rest assured, that doesn't happen too often. Kevin Spacey plays the heist kingpin in a cliched manner, and most of the supporting players follow his lead. Baby Driver is supposed to be some kind of nostalgia trip with a touch of irony.

The script by Norman Wexler may well include one or two slight cheesinesses (including the climax at the bridge), but the writing is completely eclipsed by the atmosphere, style and testosterone captured on camera here. Few films have captured an era better than Saturday Night Fever, and Badham recognises and makes the most of the purity and edge that is created at the intersection between 1970s youth culture, Travolta's buoyant energy, and the pulsating disco music. Today the film works as dual escapism, but it's no less relevant and no less valid than it was back in 1977 because the essence it captures is timeless - even if the wonderful music turned out to be ephemeral.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

John Travolta was fêted all around the world as the white-suited hipster ""Tony Manero"" who almost glided around the city streets - and the dance floor. Determined to improve his lot, he enters a disco competition which he thinks will change his life and what ensues for about two hours is his story. Sadly, it's not much of a story. He's not a very engaging fellow; treats women badly, has a mouth on him that could strip paint and is constantly at loggerheads with his hard working, decent, old man. Things take a turn for the more complicated when the apple of everyone's eye - his priest brother ""Frank"" (Martin Shakar) returns home announcing his intention to give up the priesthood for a life that doesn't require celibacy. Luckily, ""Tony"" teams up on the dance floor with the spunky ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) - a woman even more ambitious for a clean start than him - and that is where the film eventually takes off. On the dance floor, with the disco ball working it's magic and a collection of superb Bee Gees tracks that cannot fail to get your toes tapping. ""Night Fever""; ""Staying Alive""; If I Can't Have You"" and the more slow tempo'd ""How Deep Is Your Love"" make the soundtrack way, way, more memorable than this otherwise tawdry, tacky look at life in New York in the mid 1970s. Travolta is the star, his walk and his cocky style stand him apart from the rest of this rather depressingly anodyne story - but in the end it's a film about aspiration, dancing and the Bee Gees, and the latter elements are well worth watching.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,
6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2bb,tt0076666,Saturday Night Fever,danielgroza,14 May 2023,10,"This is one of those movies that has an aura about it. A glamorous outer shell which serves as presentation and to cover the darkness inside it. And it works. How else could I explain that, in a movie containing both an attempted rape and a suicide, the only thing I will remember is John Travolta in his immaculate white suit breaking it down on the dance floor?\nJohn Travolta plays Tony Manero, a 19-years old American-Italian living in Brooklyn with his parents. He has a dead-end job and no plans for college. But he seems to be content, at least for now, as long as he has his friends and the 2001 Odyssey nightclub. He changes when he sees a girl on the dance floor. Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) is close to being his match in dancing skills and is also part of the Manhattan upper class. She has an office job and seems to be doing pretty well. She also takes no time to lay into Tony about his shortcomings. While her snobbism is not sympathetic, it serves to wake something in Tony. He becomes more aware of himself and the world around him.\nBut is this sudden realization to become more responsible real or just driven by his insecurities and needs to impress Stephanie? At first it might be the latter, but as the movie progresses, he thinks about it more and more. Everything eventually culminates in a nervous breakdown one evening after winning a dance competition at the Odyssey. A win he believes he did not deserve and was given to him and Stephanie simply because the other couple were Puerto Rican. This racism--and the racism of his friends as well--pisses him off. Yet he is not driven by hatred, but rather frustrated by stupidity. I always consider stupidity a bigger insult to racism than evil because evil is held to a higher standard while stupidity is simply tossed aside. Indeed, by the end of the movie Tony becomes a man trying to overcome his condition.\nBut don't think this movie scoffs at the lower-to-middle class. Stephanie has her own mistakes to be ashamed of mostly related to the ways in which a young woman like her might be able to climb the corporate ranks. And she is also not the only woman in Tony's life. Anette (Donna Pescow) is an ex-girlfriend of his, stuck in the friend zone but is probably the only girl who truly loves him. He is too young to understand her feelings but it's easy to see how well they are made for each other. But the movie keeps them at an emotional distance and is ruthless in their separation. Perhaps their impossibility is what makes me wish they would reconcile even more.\nStill, while these ideas are all fine and dandy, this movie is not without flaws. The subplot of Tony's brother Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar) is dealt with really quickly. Frank is a priest, highly regarded by Tony's parents--his mother always calls him ""father"" and crosses herself each time she mentions her name--but he shocked everyone when he decided to abandon priesthood. He doesn't have a specific reason, simply not feeling like he belongs. He then leaves the movie and is never mentioned again. But not without leaving a mark. For Tony, peer pressure is a real thing and he has a guilty sense of satisfaction seeing his brother move backwards for a change. He by no means hates him, their interactions being very friendly, but he feels pressure has been taken away from him and was given time to breathe. So is this really a flaw at all?\nI always claimed that a truly great movie can depict any form of evil as long as it contains the smallest glimmer of humanity. This usually comes at the ending, but not in ""Saturday Night Fever"". Director John Badham gets it out of the way early, the first time Tony sets foot on the dance floor in his outlandish sense of fashion. The ending, in fact, offers no guarantees and doesn't solve any immediate problems. When Tony runs to Stephanie's apartment we get a feeling he has matured, perhaps understanding what true love is. But in no way do I get a sense that once the screen turns black these characters will head towards the proverbial ""happy ever after"", nor they are obliged to do so.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Sadly, coming to it now the story of a talented young man from the wrong side of the tracks and watching him make mistake after mistake on the road to self-discovery has been done so many times that its hard to really invest in this one, even if it does play an archetypal role in others.\nThat said, the music is spectacular. Travolta really can dance and it is hard to imagine this movie being anything without him in it. The ending is something as well, a strong comment on cultural norms and his characters growth. Unfortunately, it's not until that end that I'm invested in anything more than the groovy voodoo of the soundtrack.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Another problem is Travolta had reallife lady love at the time( comely actress Diana Hyland) die on him at the time and he is awful angry in scenes because of that.\nYet, some of it somehow remains timeless. The theme of escaping the world you were born into, Catholic religion in your family and it's hold or loosening hold on you, gathering with your friends, dating ladies if you are a guy and more.\nLook. I do not use know how the film would have worked if there had been a violent lady in the film who beat people up. So many viewers are bothered by the depiction of ladies in this movie but they are all basically nice and make calm viewing. Besides, most women in real life are nice and not full of bad attitude.

I was too young to watch this in the cinema, but several years later I did watch the recut PG friendly version on the big screen.\nIt was many years later I watched the raw expletive ridden original adult version.\nBased on a somewhat fictional article by Nik Cohn.

Just like his revered older brother decided to leave the priesthood as that was not the life for him.\nThere is a rawness to Saturday Night Fever, it mirrors movies like Mean Streets, Serpico and Rocky. Tony has posters of Al Pacino and Sly Stallone in his bedroom.\nOf course there are also classic disco songs, mainly by the Bee Gees. What makes the movie is the various dance scenes, especially the iconic solo dance moves to the song You Should Be Dancing.\nThe movie attracted critical acclaim when it was released. It was not a movie that critics were sniffy about and puzzled why it managed to be such as a big public hit.

The film has one of the most iconic opening sequences to a film I have ever seen. John Travolta is the epitome of charm and style in this film. He captures and owns every scene he is in with his charisma and unique looks.\nThe plot is another story. It is not all bad as one can see a degree of realism. Poor or simple neighborhoods are shown and the main cast do not shy away from foul language. They almost come across as a small gang and Tony is their leader. The characters have depth and are not superficial. There is some story, strong emotions and issues they need to deal with. Ultimately Tony is a young man trying to find himself and find something more. This is why he is taken by the stuck up Stephanie. I feel if the story was rewritten with more depth and a stronger story then this could have become one of greatest films of all time. The other elements already existed: incredible music from the Bee Gees, strong talent from Travolta and a favorable setting.\nOne can see why this film became famous. The music is a hit on its own.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2c1,tt0181875,Almost Famous,NoDakTatum,9 December 2023,10,"Based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's experiences as a teenage music journalist, ""Almost Famous"" is one of the best rock and roll films ever made. Patrick Fugit is William Miller, a budding writer who is sent on an article assignment by a Rolling Stone magazine editor who thinks he is much older. William meets up with the fictional band Stillwater, and immediately falls for one of the band's groupies (they call themselves ""band aids""), Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who looks and sounds just like her mom Goldie Hawn). As the band tours, and does all the rock star decadence, Fugit's mother Elaine waits and worries back home. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as a mother who thinks she is very liberal and free thinking, but still worries for her child's welfare. The band eventually welcome William into their inner circle, and the conflict between lead singer Jeff (Jason Lee) and charismatic guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup). A running gag involves William's complete inability to get Russell to sit down to an interview. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderful as the late great Lester Bangs, the rock critic who is now worshiped by critics everywhere (even though all he ever did, that was different from others, was be completely honest). Lester warns William never to befriend the band, something William cannot help. As the band makes its way across the country, William gets pressure from Rolling Stone, groupies, and his mother.\nI usually have no sympathy for musicians and celebrities who complain and give into the temptations and trappings of the road and too much money. Cameron Crowe does not excuse the bad behavior here, he shows how it is expected of the band. They are a rock band and must behave like animals, and party, and have groupies. Crowe makes the band so likable, and real, I could not help but keep watching them. The entire cast here is excellent. There is not one false line or stilted performance to be found. Fugit, for being a newcomer, is especially good. Crowe does a great job directing, not falling into the usual rock film trappings. The concert scenes give the viewer a sense of time, place, and music, and are short enough not to bore. Joe Hutshing and Saar Klein should have won Oscars for editing, keeping the pace flowing smoothly but never showing off. I think this film flopped at the box office because the studio did not know how to market it. Who wants to see another movie about how hard stardom is? Instead, this is a sweet, funny comedy. McDormand's telephone conversation with Crudup, and the plane scene where everyone confesses their deepest secrets, are two of the finest pieces of writing EVER, not just in the film. I put off watching ""Almost Famous"" for too long, I hope you do not make the same mistake.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

Because Cameron Crowe didn't want to create any kind of hostility or resentment amongst the living, he decided it would be best if it was made as a story with made up characters. Also another one of it's set backs are that their isn't too many gifted young writer's that are able to be given an awesome job for writing for a magazine company in which not many people can relate to! As far as the story is concerned, this is what I know so far is that this film is about a young Cameron Crowe traveling with what people expect to be Led Zepplin and that it's public knowledge that he used to write for a magazine called the Rolling Stones and these are his adventures while traveling with them and as working as a writer! That because of his job, he is incapable to express any emotion or to take any sides, just like newsman, journalists and the soldiers of the army. My rating would've been higher but the scene where William Miller played by Patrick Fugit finally spoke out and says something to the band he was traveling with is a total cop out! Cameron Crowe was able to travel with this band as well as write about them and because he was a gifted writer was not able to say anything which is totally something film critic Roger Ebert could relate to since he gave this film the best of 2000!

It's kind of similar to Dazed and Confused type of thing about high school antics in a very cliched and dramatized way which likely either never happened or is so dramatized as to be similar to thinking real life is like a soap opera, not even close. I don't know how it gets so much cred as great because I don't see it at all, there's nothing powerful, no redeeming arc or great story to it. I get the soundtrack is great but a mixtape could do that on a road trip in a much more real way than this. Like most of what transformerwood does it's pushed on us and programmed by them through passive violence to be great. Cameron Crow, cc33, likely just has the juice and backing to get this done for him nothing more. Mass delusion and cult mentality of so many supposedly real reviews and numbers here are suspicious to say the least and I have serious doubts as to the shenanigans played here. Thus to get real reviews almost everything above a 6 is worthless drivel for the vast majority of this imagery industry offerings. The self promotion and awards of this industry doesn't make it real or great, it's just making up awards and convincing everyone gullible enough that there's some reality to it. Similar to those long titles that various orders give themselves to sound so great and important, well anyone can do that, just get enough cadres together to give it a reality of fantasy. And the main character, among others, is easily a transformer if you know what to look for.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

I love how Cameron took his experience from his teenage years with multiple bands and molded it into the infamous Stillwater. You can just tell this is all from real- life experience. (Although of course they had to slap on that copyright notice that these are all fictitious moments but if you've read anything about Crowe's life, you know it all happened)\nNothing compares to those moments of the tour bus driving through those small towns of America, most namely the Tiny Dancer scene. This moment in cinema is STILL talked about 20+ years later, making it one of the most iconic movie scenes. That's not to forget the GOLDEN GOD, ""DON'T TAKE DR-GS"" and the plane scenes either.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2c8,tt0181875,Almost Famous,beardsworthy,4 March 2023,9,"""Almost Famous"" is a delightful and heartwarming movie that celebrates the spirit of rock and roll and the freedom of youth. Directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a teenage music journalist who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to go on tour with the up-and-coming rock band, Stillwater. As he travels with the band and learns about the music industry, he also navigates his own coming-of-age journey.\nBut what sets ""Almost Famous"" apart is its attention to detail and authenticity. From the music to the costumes to the dialogue, every aspect of the film captures the essence of the 1970s music scene with remarkable accuracy. The performances are also outstanding, with standout turns from Kate Hudson as the band's ""Band-Aid"" Penny Lane, Billy Crudup as guitarist Russell Hammond, and Frances McDormand as William's overprotective mother.\nAnd if you think the theatrical release of ""Almost Famous"" is great, wait until you see the untitled director's cut. Clocking in at nearly three hours, this version of the film includes extended scenes and additional plot points that deepen the characters and expand on the story. It's a rare example of a director's cut that improves upon an already fantastic film.\nThe untitled director's cut is more than just a longer version of ""Almost Famous."" It's a richer, more immersive experience that immerses you even deeper in the world of the film. The added scenes give the characters more depth and complexity, making you care about them even more. And the music, always a highlight of the film, is even more prominent and memorable.\nIn short, ""Almost Famous"" is a must-see movie for anyone who loves music, coming-of-age stories, or just great filmmaking in general. And the untitled director's cut is one of the best versions of the film ever made, offering an even more rewarding and unforgettable cinematic experience.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

The film is a slice of life much like Crowe's other project Jerry Maguire was in the mid 1990's only that Almost Famous uses more of an ensemble cast to tell the story than two or three actors like we saw in Crowe's sports agent film. Some key players to this VERY young cast include Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, and Jason Lee just to name three. Winning the Oscar in 2001 for best original screenplay, this film is extremely well written with good flow to it, the acting by the young cast is fair but the film does come to a satisfying conclusion at the end. Dealing with a music group & music in general in the 1970's & being a Cameron Crowe film at that you would assume this film has an exceptional soundtrack both classically and traditionally and you would be right!! It's a fun movie with many twists and turns that turns out well in the end!! 7 out of 10 stars!!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4a,,,,,

It is a great look at the coming of age of America at this time as well as Rock N Roll. The script, Direction, and cinematography is well done.

The movie was the first made after Jim Henson's untimely death, so it had a lot riding on it to see how the franchise would continue. It took me nearly 3 decades to get myself to watch it because I still hadn't gotten over his death. I mention this because it affected my perception of the film.\nI first saw it in 2020 when I was going through some tough times. A close friend of mine had it on his ""must see at Christmas"" list every year so I finally agreed to watch it. I was immediately taken back to those days and months after Mr. Henson's passing, when I was only 13. But this time, instead of denial, I saw a charming love letter to the man who helped shape my childhood. I couldn't have been happier to see that his legacy lived on.\nNow, moving on to the movie itself, I found it to be cleverly scripted, brilliantly acted by both the human performers, and the muppet performers, and enhanced by some very catchy and meaningful songs. The story is told in the familiar fashion that most people know but with moments of absurdity and silliness that help lighten the mood, but still highlight one troubled man's path toward redemption.\nIt is often forgotten that one cannot define a person by their actions alone. Scrooge's nephew continues to speak of the good that must be bubbling beneath the surface. As the past and present spirits reveal the true reasons behind his misery and foul demeanor, the viewer may change their thoughts on the man. Redemption is potentially possible once the pain is revealed and set free. In this situation, I am happy to see the change in him.\nIt's a cute movie with muppets, but it tells the story well, and I feel it is a fair movie to watch with children. Open discussion on the themes can be helpful in reminding them that what's on the surface may be hiding a pain that one knows nothing about. Be kind to one another.

Charity workers should not force donations and judge people who do not give money. He's rich, and paying the large amount of tax without committing crimes to evade tax is the most primal responsibility as he said. Soundtracks are surprisingly amazing.

It's the humour that keeps that in check.\nDon't misunderstand, when it comes to the scenes of Christmas yet to come. That part would scare kids, but there is a message behind that. Because the future hasn't been written yet, people can make changes to the future to make not only there future bright, but other people as well, especially during the festive season.\nAlthough I don't know much about Charles Dickens, this is one story i can relate to. For those who are unaware, there is a museum dedicated to him in London, UK. Trust me, its worth visiting it, especially at this time of year.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

Only Scrooged is in competition with it in my opinion, but that differs quite a bit from the original.\nThe muppets are great, Michael Caine is great, the effects are great. I'm not sure I can think of an actor who could do a better job. Kermit is a perfect fit to play Scrooge's mistreated assistant, since we're used to seeing him play a similar role with Miss Piggy.\nJust watched this recently and it's surprisingly well done for a first time director.\nLooking forward to watching it in the future so that I can start to memorize the songs.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

I generally watch it at some point over Christmas, and I think if anything familiarity has obscured the fact that it is just not a very good idea. The incorporation of existing Muppet characters into the story has only limited success, and sometimes the attempt is jarring. The use of Gonzo to link it, with Rizzo the rat (not previously an important character), is downright awkward. The landscapes look more like America than Britain, and some of the accents are distinctly hokey. Paul Williams' numbers are not the strongest, and even Scrooge himself, Michael Caine, doesn't compare well to the many great previous performances. Caine is okay as long as he can underplay - when he tries to emote, it's not a good look.\nBut it is fun, certainly a helluva lot better than Muppet Treasure Island. Miss Piggy, with her lookalike and actalike daughters Bettina and Belinda, is fantastic.\nFor what it's worth, I think the best Muppets film is the revival one with Jason Segel.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

I don't enjoy the Muppets or quite understand why people are so fanatically in love with them. I grew up on Sesame Street and still don't love the Muppets. Most of the time, the Muppets are just goofy ridiculousness. I have a sense of humor, but I don't love the puppetry and characters. I do love Dickens' tale, and I believe Henson did well here with it. Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge is award-worthy. I'll watch this again, and that surprises me.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2df,tt0067992,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,Reviews_of_the_Dead,1 January 2024,9,"This was a movie that my sister and I grew up with. It is one that we'd watch in a steady rotation. I'll be honest though; this was a movie that I hadn't seen in probably 25 or so years. Jaime and I wanted to revisit this one after having seen the prequel of Wonka. We wanted to see how well it could fit in story-wise.\nThen for this adaptation of the source material, we are following Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum). He is a poor boy who lives with his mother, Mrs. Bucket (Diana Sowle), her parents who include Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), as well as her deceased husband's parents. All the grandparents are confined to one bed. Mrs. Bucket works in a laundry where Charlie has picked up a job delivering newspapers.\nIn the area, there is the infamous Wonka Chocolate Factory. It has been sealed up for some time. All that comes out would be the products that are made there. Things change though when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) hosts a contest, offering a lifetime supply of chocolate to the winners. There are five golden tickets hidden in the wrapper of chocolate bars. This brings Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner), Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson) and Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) to the factory along with one guardian. Charlie is also the improbable last guest with his grandfather.\nIt is inside that they all get a taste of the madness of Wonka and his crew that help him produce his candy. They are a strange race known as Oompa Loompas. The kids are told not to do it and when they go against what Wonka said, we see what the repercussions are. Wonka isn't fully letting on what his plan is and it will take a true act of kindness to succeed.\nWhat I'm going to say to lead off here is that this is a fun movie. Wilder is perfectly cast in this eccentric role of Wonka. He adds snark and sarcasm to the role that make me laugh. It is funny that Jaime looked at me multiple times while watching this to say that is something I'd say. Something interesting is that Wonka is supposed to be a jovial person. I get part of that here, but he also seems tired and just over the world as well. It makes sense in the end as well.\nThis version of the story is a fantastical story and place that still feels grounded in the real world. Things seen inside of this factory don't make sense to the visitors, but to Wonka, it is normal. I do love that as it is a tough line to walk. It does a great job at capturing the heart of Roald Dahl's novel and bringing it to life. I'll be honest though, I had this read to me when I was in fourth grade, but I don't remember a lot of the book for obvious reasons. It is impressive that this is done at a time of practical effects as well. That adds charm to it.\nWhat also makes this work is the acting. I've said how good Wilder is. It is interesting that with the new one out, Timothée Chalamet feels like the younger version to me. Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe, a character that is problematic while still being beloved. I thought that Ostrum was good as Charlie. He has the best heart and intentions of the golden ticket winners. Cole, Nickerson, Themmen and Bollner are good as the other kids who have character flaws that explain why they fall victim to different things in the factory. Roy Kinnear, Leonard Stone, Nora Denney and Ursula Reit are all good as well as the parents who should shoulder blame. All the Oompa Loompas are great and the rest of the cast push our characters to where they end up.\nI'll then end this out saying that this is a classic. It is a funny movie. There are good messages here that have a different feeling now that I'm a parent. The acting is good. This is a well made movie. Extra credit there to make this fantastic place come to life in what feels like a real world. This captures that the best. Effects are good as are the different songs that we hear. That is something else, this is a well made musical as well. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it in awhile as this is just great.\nMy Rating: 9 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

It's funny, smart, and surprisingly well shot for a 70s movie.\nThe other actors do great and the oompa loompas are something else. The oompa loompas are my absolute favorite part of the movie and that song they sing hits different. The oompa loompa song while it's not in the book it's amazing.\nParents there is nothing to say that's inappropriate or violent about this movie.

This movie is a classic the acting isn't awful, it's not the best but it's definitely passable. The music is very hit or miss but the songs definitely have their moments. The set design is easily what makes this film so famous. It really captures the beauty and charm of Roal dahls imagination. The world feels very creative and anyone would want to see it themselves. The movie also has weirdly scary imagery and I don't know why and I'm not even 100% sure if it's done on purpose, but it's definitely their. The comedy is also astounding in this film. Gene wilder is amazing in this film he's similar in a way to bill murray in the first ghostbusters, just much more subtle with it. Finally, I think the story isn't the best. There's a lot of obvious plot holes that kinda ruin it and even when you look behind that, all the characters are very 2 dimensional even the star Charlie.

I have to admit, I really liked what they did with the new movie! There was a lot of intelligent dialog (and songs - and I don't like musicals in general ... well that is what I thought to say the least) and a lot of fantasy and great set design (costumes and everything else included).\nBut back to this (no pun intended either), a movie that I assume many have a weak spot for! Especially if they have seen it as kids. And while it does seem to have quite a few adult themes in there (and can feel gruesome I reckon), it is fun to watch with quite the great performance by Wilder! The new movie (prequel) is taking a few things that you may know from this - like the Oompa Loompa (song) to name just one thing.\nThe beginning of this movie right here is a bit ... well bumpy. At least it felt weird to say the least - I understand that the movie needs to get the kids and introduce them to the audience ... but it feels badly aged in trying to be ... well funny and savvy and critical (consumerism and so forth).\nIf you don't mind the sometimes grim methods and can dig the humor of the movie (also dark at times), you will like it. How conceivable everything is? Well suspension of disbelief and all that ... chocolate is the name of the game, but being good and righteous is what really helps you move along or rather forward.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

He is absolutely crazy, unhinged and charming at the same time, which is how real psychopaths are. Now from what I remember from the Johnny Depp version, he portrayed the character as an awkward, bumbling genius kind of guy, that may be more like how movies portray psychopaths? So either way, it seems the consensus is that Willy Wonka is a psychopath.\nOther than that, the movie was a delight to watch filled with childlike wonder, sometimes scary, sometimes wild. A not-so-subtle implication of supporting slavery while criticizing capitalism but with no regard for the government. But I'm gonna take things here more at face value considering the nature of the film and the time it came out.

I get that the kids are supposed to be brats and that there is supposed to be some lesson in here for kids to be better behaved, but come on, kids are kids, and of course they would be excited to tour a chocolate factory. Why on earth this supposed kids musical decides to maim, mutilate and kill off the principal child characters is beyond me, but I found it disturbing as a child, and I still find it disturbing as an adult.

Johnny Depp gives his best in personation of Michael Jackson in the height of his wacko Jacko era, and while this does provide a few Chuckles, it just makes the movie weird and not in a fun way. He's not the biggest problem with the movie though, as the biggest problem is Tim Burton's brand of weirdness. I like Tim Burton when the weirdness comes naturally and not when they have hired Tim Burton to be weird.

Even though I know what to expect, it still takes me by surprise every time she steps into Munckin City. The performances, songs and dance numbers are extremely zany, catchy and camp but it blends in well with the ridiculousness of the film itself. The actors were well selected and every main character plays there part extremely well - the munchkins are a little flat I have to say but their songs and costumes make up for the lack of acting skills. The 4K image is crystal clear and the downside to that is certain special effects are extremely noticable and not always effectuve - such as the visible trap door when the Wicked Witch appears/disappears in the Munckim City or when the Wicked Witch flies on her broom around the castle and you can tell it's a small toy on a string or wire. Even though I did laugh at these on my recent watch through, i also appreciated the skill and effort it took to achieve such special effects in 1939 - and it would of looked perfectly realistic on CRT TV, VHS and DVD...\nFinal Verdict:\nThis movie is a classic and a much loved family favourite for many generations.

Even though this film was released in 1939, it still captures the attention of viewers today with its cinematic magic. It's a story for all ages which features beautiful visuals, memorable music, elaborate sets, and unforgettable characters.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2f5,tt0032138,The Wizard of Oz,Prince-P,21 November 2023,8,"In the late 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's studio head Louis B. Mayer had a serious conversation with some of his employees. Mayer wanted MGM to make a fantasy film in the style of Walt Disney's hugely successful ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" from the previous year. After some thought, producer Mervyn LeRoy suggested that L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" could be adapted into a movie. After all, Baum's work was considered an American classic.\nAt that time most films were made in black and white. Working in color meant you had to use a whole new type of camera - and they were big and cumbersome. In addition, MGM was forced to accept a so-called ""Technicolor consultant"" from the camera manufacturer. A man who stood next to the cinematographer and told him how to light every scene. Mayer didn't care, though. He wanted to compete with Disney's pioneering feature. And ""Snow White"" was in color.\n""The Wizard of Oz"" was made exclusively at the MGM Studios in Culver City. But it was a messy production. The first director was fired after 12 days. Victor Fleming took over, but he was moved to ""Gone with the Wind"". So, it was up to King Vidor to finish the film. And there were cast changes, too. The Tin Man had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup and had to be replaced. The Wicked Witch was severely burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto (the dog) was out of commission for a week after being stepped on by a crew member.\nThe film had its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Judy Garland then went on an East Coast publicity tour, which included the New York opening of ""Oz"". But it didn't help. ""The Wizard of Oz"" had been so expensive to produce that MGM made a net loss of millions. The studio didn't get their money back until 1949, when the movie had its re-release worldwide. The following year, MGM sold the rights to TV, where the film has been shown ever since.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

While poking fun at this kind of classic, innocent fantasy has become somewhat of a trend in recent years, the film itself has aged well, and will likely retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.\nUndoubtedly part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from their being old friends with so many cinema fans, but there's also a good reason why they've endured so long, and have endured even after. Becoming all too familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent yet deep passion that is easy to identify with. Also, the 'Oz' characters are quirky enough to remain interesting, but there is a core element that is again believable. Who doesn't feel like they could use at least one of the things Dorothy's friends love?\nThe adaptation from the original story was well done, making good choices for characters and episodes to work into the film. The settings and visual effects may not impress devotees of computer imagery today, but in their time they certainly showed great skill and planning, and even today, in their own way they are more believable than most computer tricks that have become overused.\nThe famous story has also been used for several more recent adaptations, and some of them have their own good points.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b2fb,tt0032138,The Wizard of Oz,fernandoschiavi,27 July 2023,8,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of the most remembered and beloved films of all time. From his moving story of overcoming and self-acceptance perfectly outlined by L. Frank Baum to technical-artistic innovations, Victor Fleming's work does not seem to age. Even contemporary filmmakers, especially those who dare to venture into the world of fantasy, seek references from the classic feature film, remodeling them in an attempt to bring them closer to the new generations. However, its timelessness is perhaps one of its greatest attributes - after all, who doesn't know the story of Dorothy, the ruby slippers, the feared sorcerer of the Emerald City and the flying monkeys? Of course, restricting oneself only to narrative devices is falling into common sense; after all, the plot that unfolds goes far beyond what the eyes can see.\nOne of Victor Fleming's great assets was the characterization of two totally different worlds. Dorothy feels trapped in a cyclical routine in Kansas, and her arrival in a totally unfamiliar place is reason for a compulsory, but justified, enchantment. Therefore, it is almost instantaneous to notice why the director opted for sepia in reality and technicolor in the fantastic, in the supernatural - and I come to say that the skills of the artistic team far surpass the failed attempts to bring color to the big screen. Based on this dual principle, the scenic narrative maintains a balance between the old and the new (for the time), in addition to creating a hybrid trend that would be revisited decades later. Even if in the eyes of today's audience, the sets are quite artificial and the special effects somewhat naive, it is impressive to see what was done in a feature film shot in the late 30's of the last century. The make-up, although harmful to the health of the actors, is of an incredible quality, transforming talented performers into scarecrows, tin men, lions and hideous witches. The art direction is a show apart, with scenarios created with great care, showing us in a sublime way how magical and colorful that place is. It helps a lot that the first few scenes of the film feature a beautiful sepia, marking the difference between Kansas and Oz.\nSummarizing ""The Wizard of Oz"" in ""there's no place like home"" is too reductive, not to mention silly. Reductionist, because it ignores the various subtexts to focus exclusively on the expressed text; silly, because it makes no sense that Dorothy prefers an oppressive reality symbolized by sepia-toned photography to a fantastic and happy universe that explores what Technicolor was beginning to offer. The Land of the Munchkins is brightly colored, full of joy, and makes Dorothy a hero (since she would have killed the Wicked Witch of the East). Thus, it makes no sense to read the text in this shallow way. The idea of the protagonist's transition makes sense, but there is much more to be interpreted.\nIn the first act, a preliminary lesson: there will always be troubles to be faced. Dorothy leaves Kansas thanks to one of her wishes, she wants to go over the rainbow because their problems melt away and dreams come true. That's what she says in the very powerful Leitmotiv ""Over the Rainbow"", rocked by the smooth voice of a Judy Garland still at the beginning of her brilliant career. The fantastic place where she goes may have the colors and joys she wanted, but it's not without adversity, as the Wicked Witch of the West soon appears.\nAfterwards, the message is that the journey is much better in the company of friends. The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), the Tin Man (Jack Haley) and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) show up to help Dorothy on her walk - and their characterization, in terms of makeup and costume, is simply superb, standing out the second because the actor reveals himself attentive to a body language compatible with the physical limitations of the character - and so that it also helps them. The four-want magic to achieve their goals, acquiring elements they don't have. With their union (and a little help from the kind Witch of the North), the obstacles brought by the Wicked Witch of the West are overcome.\nIt is in the third act that they meet the Magician, when there are two narrative dismemberments. The first is the ratification of a past message, that the supernatural (including the divine) does not exist. The Wizard is as much of a charlatan as Professor Marvel, simply because magic and deities exist only in the imagination. The god shaped by religions, the one to whom personal yearnings are directed, simply does not exist. Wishes can come true, but not by a divine grant. It is necessary - and here comes the second lesson of the third act - to believe and trust in oneself, because all people have the virtues that they believe they do not have. Therefore, the power of belief should not be directed towards an imaginary immaterial being (god-God), but towards oneself. Self-confidence is stronger than it may seem.\nSupporting the interpretation according to which ""The Wizard of Oz"" conveys the idea that god does not exist are small subliminal messages, such as the tree scene and a questioning offered by Dorothy - without forgetting the moment when the Wizard is unmasked by Toto. In the first case, when the protagonist tries to pluck apples from the trees to feed herself, the fruits are soon forgotten, as if they had no relevance. It is enough to associate apples with the biblical meaning of temptation to conclude that, from the point of view of the feature, the religious text is disposable. Later, when Dorothy is told that no one has ever seen the Wizard of Oz, she herself has the wit to question how they know he exists. Through impressive bucolic settings for its time, director Victor Fleming makes ""The Wizard of Oz"" an imagery spectacle. The contrast between Kansas and Oz would be enough to convey the visual richness conceived in the literary work, but the symbolism of the parable, combined with Garland's formidable performance in the lead role, are some of the elements that make this a priceless and timeless film. In short, this is its magic.\nTo attribute ""The Wizard of Oz"" to being a simple work of fantastic fiction is to commit an unforgivable mistake. Fleming not only prints his perspective on Baum's novel, but also recovers its critical elements. Written in 1900, the rise of a powerful and feared force is a reflection of imperialist governments imposing their will on minorities - in this case, the abusive relationship between the Witch and the munchkins. The appearance of an ethereal and ""intangible"" force arises with Glinda (Billie Burke), the Good Witch of the South, and advocates an imminent change in the authoritarian configurations of Oz. After all, from what we can gather, it is Dorothy who brings what is necessary to depose the Wicked Witch of the West and reveal the real intentions of the Wizard (Frank Morgan), a charlatan who assumed this role to deceive and gain the respect of the population of Esmeralda. Bringing these elements to the end of the 1930s is also burdensome, as the time was ripe for the growth of extremist movements, including Nazi-fascism, and for the onset of World War II.\nThe feature also brings technical innovations, as already mentioned. The use of vibrant colors and competent art direction is just icing on the cake; mention should be made of the scenic dexterity with which Fleming leads the narrative with exquisite mastery, creating choreographies that are not limited to the visual plane, but extend to their respective causes and consequences. The frames bring aesthetic refinement and resemble neo-romantic paintings, scrutinized by excessive and involving fantasy. By the way, it is not by chance that the film's special effects represent a considerable leap for the niche in question, from the use of hundreds of costumes to the meticulous makeup. Indeed, some sequences are unforgettable. Whether in Garland's rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"", crowned with the Oscar for Best Original Song, or in the phrase that summarizes the entire scope of the work, countless constructions were reused over time and, despite not having reached the same success than the original, serve as beautiful and simple tributes to one of the greatest films of all time. And as the credits roll on screen, it's hard not to get emotional. In the end, only one thing is certain: there is no place like home.\nIn the cast, Judy Garland is simply adorable as young Dorothy, even at an advanced age for the role - the actress was 16 years old when she recorded her participation, playing a child character. Her sweetness in her eyes and her words easily convinced the audience that this could be the perfect Dorothy, even more so with such a remarkable performance in (Somewhere) Over the Rainbow right at the beginning of the film. For the film to win over the viewer, it is necessary for him to believe in the journey of the characters and Garland does a magnificent job as little Dorothy in front of the cast, which also has great performances - especially the affected Lion played by Bert Lahr.\nThe production is full of behind-the-scenes legends, including director changes - the first, Richard Thorpe, was fired 12 days after filming began, George Cukor lasted only 3 days, Victor Fleming took over for four months and left to direct ""... Gone with the wind"" and King Vidor finished the feature - The Wizard of Oz is not for nothing one of the greatest classics of cinema, awarded with Oscars for Soundtrack and Original Song, the famous ""Over the Rainbow"", almost cut by the producers who they thought she was ""pessimistic"".\n""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of those productions that will never lose the interest of the public, conquering viewers of all ages for its ingenuity and charisma when telling a story of universal appeal.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

However, for future generations, this film became truly popular and was of great importance - its popularity skyrocketed in the 1950s thanks to the annual Christmas broadcasts on television. Judy Garland, whose wonderful performance as Dorothy attracted attention, became a real star thanks to this film.\nThe story is probably known to everyone. The heroine of the fairy tale, hiding from a sudden tornado, finds herself in her room and is magically transported to a country where she is met by funny midgets, a beautiful fairy and the sister of an evil witch, whom she accidentally crushed with her house. An evil witch is going to deal with the girl. And then the adventure begins with the famous yellow brick road, interesting friends, including a Scarecrow without brains, a Lion that is afraid of everyone and everything, as well as an Iron Woodcutter who dreams of finding a heart. The picture has a pretty enough visual range for its time, as well as pleasant songs. Well, ""Over the Rainbow"" became a true hit, besides taking the Oscar statuette for Best Song.\nThe film was created with a very careful attention to detail. This is especially noticeable when you view the picture decades after its release. The creators paid attention to many details so that the audience would have no doubts. This fairy tale is really a real story. And if adults are aware that this is only a movie, then it will be difficult to deceive young viewers who are the main target audience of the project, leaving some kind of fake both in the surrounding locations and objects, and in the game of the cast. And the development team coped with the task perfectly.\nToday, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classic with a capital letter. An amazing adventure into a fairy-tale world with its own laws, interesting events and a great history of friendship and support. This project has become important, in my opinion, for many generations of children who have managed to see a gorgeous film adaptation of the world-famous story of the writer Lyman Frank Baum. The picture gives you the opportunity to enjoy vivid adventures, memorable songs and dances, as well as to understand what true devotion and friendship mean.\n8 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

That would be unfair. Certainly, Albert Broccoli and his team worked to produce as good a musical as was being produced in America at the time. They hired Van Dyke, and they tried to get Julie Andrews. They hired the Sherman brothers to write the songs, which are pretty good (except I despise as lazy the title song). They got Roald Dahl to do the screenplay; if anyone understood the darkness at the heart of childhood and how to write about it, it was he.\nUnfortunately, they then handed it to Ken Hughes to direct, and he could direct trained adult actors and action scenes, but not children. In the end, they spent lots of money, which is on the screen, to produce a road show musical, just as the genre was going stale. While it did well at the box office, its immense costs made it a failure, so they didn't try again. As a result, the movie musical, like the cartoon, entered a dead period from which it, unlike the cartoon, has yet to really recover.\nLooking at it today, it's quite obviously too long. There's lots of wasted luxury casting, like Lionel Jeffries, Benny Hill, and Sally Ann Howes.

Sure, it has it's cheesy moments, but there is genuine chemistry between the characters on display here and coupled with some superbly catchy - and often poignant - lyrics from the Sherman twins, we are presented with a really quite enjoyable fable. The Potts family live in a dilapidated farmhouse. Grandfather (Lionel Jeffries); the well meaning but hopeless inventor of a father ""Caractacus"" (Dick Van Dyke) and the two children ""Jeremy"" (Adrian Hall) and ""Jemima"" (Heather Ripley). Luckily, one day the youngsters are nearly run over by ""Truly"" (Sally Ann Howes) the daughter of the wealthy confectioner ""Lord Scrumptious"" (James Robertson Justice). She might just be able to help the father make a few quid from her father with his sweets that double up as pan pipes. Meantime, the family manage to rescue an old rust bucket from the local garage, and lo and behold, enter our eponymous vehicle. It can drive, it can become an aeroplane, an hovercraft - indeed it can do just about everything bar make the tea. It's a must-have prize for the megalomaniac child-hater ""Baron Bomburst"" (Gert Fröbe - who really does enter into the spirit of the story), so the family must fight tooth and nail to stop their car, and themselves, falling into his malevolent hands. Ian Fleming demonstrates great imagination with this and Van Dyke shows off his varied skills well and engagingly. Howes over-cooks her singing at times, but the almost 2½ hours this story takes really does fly by. The Oscar winning ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""; the delightful ""Hushabye Mountain""; ""Me Ol' Bamboo"" and Jeffries' enjoyable rendition of ""Posh!"" as he is gradually drowned in his outhouse all add bundles to this colourful and joyous series of well photographed escapades.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b304,tt0062803,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,I_Ailurophile,8 April 2023,10,"When I told a friend that I was soon going to watch this for the first time, he half-jokingly warned that the more one watches, the less it makes sense. That remark bears more truth to it than I could have supposed, for this is an unending stream of such wild fancy that it splits the divide between pure imagination and straight-up fever dream. This is never more true than with the incredibly lighthearted, fleet-footed songs of Richard M. And Robert B. Sherman, and the impeccable, wondrous choreography of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, but that same duality comes across in pretty much every last regard. The incredible filming locations are made to feel rather whimsical themselves, aided to that end in light of production design and art direction that really seem to adopt the ethos of ""if you can dream it, we'll find a way to include it."" This also goes for the wide-ranging frivolity of the costume design, and the terrific hair and makeup; every stunt, visual effect, sound effect, and fabricated conjuration looks great at the same time that it's often a little bewildering. And still we're just scraping the surface of everything 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' represents, and as if to emphasize the point - what a name!\nFor everything that fills these two and one-half hours, there's weirdly not that much plot in it. At the same time, at almost exactly the halfway mark it's like a switch has been flipped, taking us from considerable content with minimal substance, to total cartoonish silliness. This is more curious still when one realizes that the original book was written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming, the screenplay was adapted by director Ken Hughes (also associated with strange 1967 disaster 'Casino Royale') with children's book author and notorious bigot Roald Dahl - and that Albert R. Broccoli, who was behind so much of Eon Productions' 007 franchise, also produced this, with a cast including Gert Fröbe (Goldfinger), Desmond Llewelyn (Q), and Benny Hill (he of ""Yakkety sax"" fame). And still, Hughes' orchestration of every shot and scene, and Christopher Challis' cinematography, similarly embrace that same spirit of unbridled fun while at once also being stupendously smart and delicious in and of themselves. Not to be outdone, Irwin Kostal penned a score (informed by the Shermans' tunes) that's perfectly light and cheerful over every scene in which the cast give wholehearted performances of unyielding merriment and zest.\n'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is unremitting in its extravagant ridiculousness, a cavalcade of one gag and bit after another. Yet like The Beatles' surrealist quasi-nightmare 'Yellow submarine,' it's that complete immersion in the inane that allows this to work; add a tinge of sincerity to provide an almost indifferent anchor, and the stage is set for this to be whatever it wants. Irreverent as it all is, however, every last element is guided toward the same ends, and the result is nothing less than fabulous. Everyone involved in the production turned in truly outstanding work across the board, and that includes the screenplay. Where the movie decides to have a plot, it's written with sharp intelligence; where the movie insists on just having a good time, whatever that may mean, the scene writing is robust and superbly detailed, and the rest of the craftsmanship follows suit without fail. At all points the dialogue and characters are astoundingly colorful and varied in accordance with the need of a tale in which anything goes. And so it is on down the line from start to finish, as in one way or another the feature is just a boundless bounty of bounding, bouncing, buoyant joy, realized with only utmost care and skill.\nI fully expected to enjoy this, based not just on its reputation but on the strong recommendation of everyone with whom I'd ever discussed it. And still I'm ever so pleased at what a delight the film turned out to be; there are few points of comparison for a title that's so utterly resolute in its assumption of every conceivable pinch of far-flung tomfoolery. Naturally Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes curry the most favor given their prominence, but everyone in the cast and crew, and indeed everyone who participated in the work's creation, are to be congratulated for whipping up such an extraordinary, enduring, impressively enthusiastic and unfaltering flight of fancy. Given such unwavering commitment to so offbeat and preposterous an affair I can understand how this won't necessarily appeal to all - but the fact unquestionably remains that 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is so absolutely, wonderfully entertaining in every regard that I'd be hard-pressed not to give a blanket recommendation. This is a tremendous, almost unparalleled classic that never feels as long as its two and one-half hours, and is worth far more than that. More than 50 years later it continues to be an exquisite marvel, and when all is said and done it's simple a must-see. Bravo!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

There is also one of the creepiest characters to be found in any children's film in the form of the Child Catcher, brilliantly portrayed Roger Helpmann. There are all kinds of odd and unique supporting characters throughout.

The wolves were probably the scariest part of the movie, but even our young one didn't duck behind her blanket for them. The casting of Belle was spot on.

I also like the casting of the movie which they did a pretty great job on the roles they were given. Emma Watson as Bella is a decent choice, but she isn't the best actress in the movie. I also think the songs are done really well and the singing is great in the movie. Now, the CGI of the movie is something that I have mixed thoughts about.

This movie feels like it came out 26 years ago.\nDecided to finally have an open-mind on the Disney Cash Grab Remakes of the already-masterpieces they made decades ago. Kinda sorry I did, even though this movie is serviceable. Not great or even very good. It's definitely nothing I'd ever want to see again.\nThe original's near perfect, in fact, I can find very little flaws. While I love 1989's The Little Mermaid more, any argument can be made why 1991's Beauty & the Beast is superior. I mean, Belle, what an incredible character and so unselfish. I loved every bit of the 1991 version and there's a very valid reason it was the first animated movie to be nominated for best picture.\nThis updated version is just okay, I mean I didn't hate it despite the poor CGI, creepy ""inanimate"" characters, Emma Watson butchering my favorite Disney song, ""Belle"" and the terrible new songs that padded the already-too-long runtime. This 2017 version felt VERY Community Theatre and made me lighten up for the performances, as if they were actors in a neighborhood theatre pouring their hearts out.\nWHY do these remakes have to be ONE FULL HOUR longer when the stories are essentially the same? Yes, as mentioned, they add in cringe new songs, but other than that, I don't know why they subject us to mediocrity for even longer than necessary.\nThe only character I liked was the updated LeFou and believe me, I've been in his longing-for-who-you'll-never-get shoes. At least I had someone to root for and was pleased with how his arc played out.\nI wish I could say I didn't regret seeing the 2017 take, but I kinda do. Everything was flat, dark and no one could hold a Lumière to the original. Skip this.\n***\nFinal Thoughts: Really sorry this made a ton of money so Disney could open the floodgates to more embarrassing shot-by-shot ""live"" action meh remakes. Unless you have a complete reimagining, such as Maleficent or Cruella, I wish they wouldn't bother.\n(2017 version: 4/10 Stars, 1991 version: 10/10 Stars.)",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4b,,,,,

It's the fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry, Ron and Hermione returns as the iconic and unstoppable trio that every Harry Potter fan loves to watch every time. This time, Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry is getting a slight update this year. Because now, three schools are settled in together to fight each other in an epic tournament, with challenges to complete, and a great quest to finish and represent their school in honour and loyalty. This film doesn't just develop the main story greatly, but it makes small side stories to have something interesting too watch all the time. The conflict with the great and almighty Voldemort is still out there, and they did some really good and terrible scenes too represent his cruelty (Especially something we can notice in the opening scene). Hogwarts territory's are explored much more than ever in the fourth instalment, for example the lake, new areas and so. Harry Potter played by Daniel Radcliffe is showed now as a troubled, unsure and scared boy, that clearly can feel new problems coming, was great! His performance was much stronger and darker in here, his role was settled on a different level, as well as his friends, Ron and Hermione, performed by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Rector Dumbledore was also a character that came more in and out, but was clearly better included compared to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". The new teachers are always something cool and interesting, and it was once again fun too watch them in action. Speaking of action, amazing action sequences! Great camera filming, scenography, visual effects, and build-up with great suspense. Unexpected turns and uses of camera that hasn't been used in Harry Potter before, like underwater scenes and so. The music by Patrick Doyle isn't that iconic compared to the themes by John Williams, but it's rememberable and overall well written. In the end, The Goblet of Fire was entertaining, dark, mysterious and so far the best one!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

I took the change with my oldest son, as his age almost matches PG's requirements and we took the journey together and it was a marvelous one - maybe it the end of it he would, finally, touch the books themselves.\nHarry's bunch is starting to face teenagers' stuff, boys are noticing girls, hormones are bursting out and you can see envy and competition as part of their day to day activities. Even Hermione is not reacting as her usual self to some of the situations. Clearly is reflected properly by young Emma Watson.\nAt this movie we got another two brilliant British stars as Brendan Gleeson and David Tennant joined the cast and provided brilliant performances. Another two young and promising actors has joined for a one-time performance: Robert Pattinson and Clémence Poésy, I got the feeling we will hear about them in the near future.\nThe rest of the cast stayed the same and the plot became darker and more mature, as for the young love stories of the main characters. At the end of this film I could not say or remember if I ever though that one of Harry Potter's films are not great, from what I see until now, it seems that none of the movies is less then fantastic.\nIt holds for all the runtime, made with beautiful cinematography and is a visually treat, though this one is at the dark and dark water, for some of it.

The film explores a great range of emotions in our characters as they continue to mature. The tone is dark tone yet mixed in with some comic relief too. Bleaker, greyer, skies and a cooler blue outdoor colour palette hint at troubled times on the horizon for our gang. Cracks start to appear in the friendship between characters only to be strengthened later on. The sense of threat towards Harry increases too in this film, in the first couple it seems Harry might be hurt during his adventures, adventures that he himself chooses. In this film however it seems danger is out to find Harry, to put it simply somebody wants him dead, and you don't need much imagination to imagine who. The film is set almost exclusively inside Hogwarts which I thought worked well. The casting of Brendan Gleeson was also in my opinion an inspired choice.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

This is to promote friendship among the institutes. The opportunity is open to only potential contestants of seventeen years. They must enter his/her name into the goblet of fire for selection. So, you can imagine everyone's surprise to find fourteen-year-old Harry's name in the Goblet. How did his name get in the goblet? Will Harry accept the challenge?

Among the parts that were left out, I was hoping for the Blast-Ended Skrewts and the male wizard wearing the dress to get plenty of air around his private parts.\nThe series of Harry films has also matured with each rendition.

The film introduces the Triwizard Tournament, a magical competition so intense it makes the SATs look like a game of bingo. Harry, our bespectacled hero, finds himself mysteriously entered into this tournament, and let's just say it's more pressure than finding a date to the Yule Ball.\nDirector Mike Newell deserves a tip of the Sorting Hat for balancing the dark, impending doom of Lord Voldemort's return with the light-hearted, hormone-fueled drama of Hogwarts' students. The highlight? The underwater sequence where Harry grows gills and attempts to save his friends, proving that even in the wizarding world, high school is still about popularity contests and saving face - or in this case, saving Ron's face.\nThe film, however, isn't without its flaws. The pacing zips through important plot points faster than a Firebolt, leaving non-book readers to puzzle over details like ""Who is Barty Crouch Jr. And why does he twitch like that?"" But overall, ""Goblet of Fire"" casts a charming spell, complete with teenage wizards, temperamental dragons, and dance floor disasters.

This one will always be a confort film for me; as I was younger I used to truly feel and love - I still do - the romantic tone of this one; and the devastating effects that love had on our grown up characters, somehow reflecting myself in those fights and dreamy, romantic scenarios of Hogwarts on Christmas's Eve.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

This movie was amazing, different from the first 2 movies, but amazing. I hate reading ""reviews"" where the only thing they talk about is how different the movies are from the books, and you should avoid them too. It's impossible to make a movie based on a 750 page book and keep it under 4 hours long unless you skip over some parts. If you want the whole story read the books, if you want to see magical stuff and still follow Harry Potter's story in Hogwarts from a cinematic perspective, then watch the film, it's awesome.\nI give this a 9/10 only because I always thought I'd see more of Ron and Hermione in the films, but that kind of faded away after the second one. Also not much of Draco Malfoy as I was expecting. Although that's not cause of a bad film or story, but because of my flash expectations, it still took a little bit of magic from my experience. The other thing that I didn't like was how dark the movie was, although it's understandable and it suits the story that we follow in this film, I always thought of the Wizarding World as something more cheerful, colorful and magical in a different way, but again, that's my wrong image of HP before watching it.\nI'm really excited to watch the 5th one and the rest of the movies.

Of course, please rest assured that I will not talk about the Malfoy father and son here, but rather characters who are more qualified and qualified to receive care than them, such as the Crouch father and son, Qiu, Krum and Furong, and Professor Snape. Except for the touching father son confrontation before the death of Old Crouch, these people are basically all reduced to black and white backgrounds. I really know that the pursuit of a perfect image of supporting role is like asking Draco to perform ""Fall Like an Angel"" in the Goblet of Fire. But sometimes one or two seconds of concentration can make the artistic conception suddenly high. At this moment, I miss Alfonso's ""prisoner"". Although I don't think he was as successful in character design as Newell, he was able to capture the moment of human nature with a brief lens, thus creating a realm of human nature. I particularly like the scene where Lupin reminisces about Lily for Harry in the air corridor, beautiful and sad, highlighting the vicissitudes of the werewolf experience and the heartbreaking life of his own generation; Then, for the first time, Sirius saw Hogwarts Castle under the moon. In such a dangerous moment, he could stop with Harry and marvel at the beauty of his alma mater under the melodious music. Even if it was only a few seconds, it instantly enhanced the humanistic care flavor of the film, meaning a long and profound realm. In the Goblet of Fire, even the easy to play scenes of Crouch's father and son's hidden secrets and Old Diggory's loss of his beloved son are ignored in the film's rigid and rough progression. In addition, there is no haughty and arrogant hibiscus, as well as all the moments of human spirit that need to be discovered in the original work.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

The dark brooding tone feels more justified and there's a lot more of a plot to hang things on than the previous film.\nThings seem pretty rushed of course but you soon acclimatize. It helps to just let go of some of the scenes from the book you hoped to see realized.\nIt gets very high-school drama complete with Christmas prom and he-likes-her-who-likes-him-who-likes-her vibe but I actually think that balances out the attempt at a gothic tone very nicely.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

Their relationship seemed pitch perfect for their age and personality. I would love to see them again in a rom-com. They seemed natural vs that latest yell match of a rom-com of Julia Roberts in her daughter's wedding. 2. I loved the views of my Sandia Mountains. The Sandia mountains loom over everything in ABQ, and they did a great job including them in the background of many of the scenes.\nCons: 1. Seemed like they tried to make a murder mystery in the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul playbook. There are Scenes of funky architecture, dialogs inside crazy diners, murder in a 1950's era concrete apartment and another crime scene located out in the desert. Most of us from Albuquerque don't go to half these places. 2. Murder mystery? ...there was no mystery here. We know who killed who from the very beginning and so did most of the protagonists. Most reviewers mentioned that they tried to make a Cohen brothers/Fargo type story focusing on character development than mystery. 3. And lastly, an indian (from India) actor? I know there are Indians in NM, but I've lived here, worked here, and taught here most of my life and never met a single one. NM has the largest population of hispanic and native Americans and they couldn't find one to play the deputy or any other character?

Early on it starts out with some of the crime action, that many others have pointed out is a tricky pairing with comedy.\nIt jettisoned my wife for sure. But I stuck around...\nThe problem is not just that it's a crime/comedy, but the comedy is often pretty dry and well the crime is not embezzling, but let's say much wetter. Another problem is some of the absolutely stupid behavior by the ""crooks"" contrasted with the more sharp-witted dialog.\nTina Fey leans hard into her ugly ducking role, but her attractive personality plus kind of belies that. Well, then there is her ex-husband with benefits, that was sort of part of the dry humor. I noticed another review thought it was John Goodman as the assassin who has some tricks up his extra-large sleeves. But no, I think it was his stunt double.\nThe subtle work just gets murdered by the heavier overriding plot points. It's like admiring your kids chalk work on pavement drawing well within the police chalked body outline. Hard to shake that off-feeling.\nMaybe instead of trying to go Fargo, John Slattery (Hamm's old pal from Mad Men, in his 2nd full length each time with a star from that successful show)....maybe Slattery could have gone further into David Lynch territory. Even that might not have worked, here in the US with our requisite patriotic level of fear of some random act of violence, I think it's hard to laugh at mistaken identity womanslaughter.\nBottom line the film ends up being less than the sum of its parts.

I was surprised that Tina Fey was not a write or producer, and given the lengthy list of producers, she may have just asked that her name be omitted.

Mischa Barton is an English actress, I assumed she was American.\nThis looks like backdoor pilot for a mystery film series based on the florist Miranda Green (Barton) who adores mystery novels.\nShe is one of six guests invited to a small island by the mysterious and reclusive Lord Findley (Alex Hyde-White.)\nThe six disparate people meet on the train. When they arrive in Findley's vast mansion. They are met by his household staff but not Lord Findley. He is apparently stranded due to bad weather.\nNone of the people have an idea why they were invited, they are just six random strangers. Then one person is found dead, later another man. He turns out to be Lord Findley.\nIt gives Miranda an opportunity to investigate just who the murderer can be.\nSet in the 1930s, it looks sumptuous but is clearly shot in America rather than Britain. The mystery takes a long time to get going, many of the main characters are vanilla, the script is functional.\nIt does get engaging when it gets going. It is a kind of Agatha Christie tribute act.

Firstly this supposed to be southern England, but obviously none was filmed in England apart from the locomotive number 5637 and a stock shot of a train crossing a viaduct in Scotland! The follwing train train sequences was certainly not a Britsh train. Mirandas rail tickets were clearly platform tickets from the British Railways era and also were marked from Victoria to London ?? The cars at the station were American and black car miraculously appears on the island. Despite the fact that transport to the island was a small boat. The view of the island from the boat appears to have no landing stage, roads, trees or houses, let alone a mansion. Several scenes were filmed in a fairly deeply wooded area? The valet said weather conditions were precarious, but the sea was very calm! The initial shot of the boat heading to the island appeared to be empty.

Cleverly written but weird and convoluted on screen. Set in a not so idyllic '50s community that to say the film packs a twist is not at twist at all. It's disingenuous, easy, cheeky - much like the film itself, which starts off strong before crumbling into baffling storytelling choices made worse by the revolting intentions behind them. More frustrating is that the film also offers stunning craft work, a wonderfully immersive quality. In short, It is less than the sum of Florence Pugh's performance.

But that also makes it exciting, because you want to know what's behind it. Good-looking actors and actresses, beautiful fashion and the details of the set are a joy.

The plot, which I won't spoil, does have some issues which cause it to fall apart if you think too hard about questions such as ""what about...?"". But overall, this is an effective SF drama, which draws from the desire (of some) to return to a simpler, better time; the rose-tinted view of 1950s America.\nNeedless to say, what is better for me is not necessarily better for you.

I thought the movie Prisoners (2013) was an investing film with amazing performances, great cinematography, investing characters, and a mystery that made me be on the edge of my seat while watching wondering what was going to happen next; I did not know what to expect from this film, but it takes a simple premise involving two families young daughters disappearing, and does something different where it feels like a new thing.\nHugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances throughout the whole movie; Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, who is the father of one of the families who find out their daughters are missing, he goes through a lot trying to find his daughter doing certain things in intense ways where you question if this is the right way to handle the problem while also learning issues about his character that I found interesting. Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is trying his best to find out what happened to the family's daughters and where they were taken to, as he interrogates people and finds interesting clues that might connect to the incident, you are on his side, and you want to know how all of it connects; along with Detective Loki and Keller Dover having many interactions with each other questioning each other's methods and disagreements on what should be done, which I found very interesting when watching. Also, the rest of the cast such as Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano were all fantastic, especially with Viola Davis and Terrence Howard as Nancy Birch and Franklin Birch, who is the other family who lost their daughter.\nI cannot talk about whoever the antagonist is in this because it would be a spoiler, but mostly it is because every character, even the main characters have questionable problems where you wonder if they themselves are good or not. The cinematography in the movie is great with there being lots of wide shots and barely any cuts between shots, with every shot looking beautiful and giving the film a cool look and feel to it that I loved watching; plus, I will add that there is no musical score in the movie most of the time, and when there is, it makes the scenes better when they are playing out making the calm and intense moments investing and enjoyable to watch because of how well they are put together. Also, the way everything felt in the movie made it feel real, and like this could happen making the feel nerve-wracking and suspenseful.\nThough I did love the movie Prisoners (2013), it will be a while before I decide to rewatch this film, mostly because of the dark themes, how real it looks and feels, and what the movie focuses on; other than that, I highly recommend watching Prisoners (2013) if you have not already. Director Denis Villeneuve is a great director, and this movie proves that with great performances, cinematography, mystery, and a premise that is something we have seen before but done differently to make it feel new; though this is not a film that will be easy to rewatch frequently, I still recommend giving this film a watch whenever you get a chance.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4c,,,,,

Imagine that, a child actor with less than five lines and missing for majority of the movie being a better actor than the main protagonist, the dad, whose acting was passable and not convincing at all. What was even worse was that in the scenes with Anna's mum actually made me laugh out loud at the absurdity of her unrealistic version of a grieving, crying mum. Almost nothing is explained at the end of the movie, and the abductor was extremely predictable. It was obvious that it was the ------ (blanked for spoiler purposes, not that you should waste your time watching this film) from her very first appearance. The only reason why I managed to suffer through two and a half hours was so I could actually see whether I was right about who abducted the girls, and surprise surprise, I was correct.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b34d,tt0457939,The Holiday,Pjtaylor-96-138044,1 January 2024,6,"'The Holiday (2006)' is a festive rom-com that somehow runs for over two hours, making it a good deal longer than it has any right to be. It follows two women who each experience a heartbreak and decide to swap houses for the Christmas period so they can go through it alone in an entirely different location. However, fate intervenes and sends them just the men they need to get over their past loves. Positioning their new relationships almost as what saves them from their old ones is a bit problematic, I suppose, but the picture mostly dances around the issue by giving the protagonists commitment issues (on opposite ends of the spectrum) which they learn to overcome. One of the narratives is far more focused on this sort of internal development than the other, as Kate Winset's plotline more-or-less just chucks in a romance with Jack Black as a little bonus (a lot of it concerns her relationship with an ageing screenwriter, portrayed by the wonderful Eli Wallach, who helps to bring her out of her shell). This is the more interesting side of the story, for sure, but it's not given as much time as the other, far more conventional side. Thankfully, that side - which chronicles the fish-out-of-water affair between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law - is sweet and bouncy and entirely watchable. It's exactly what you'd expect from a schmaltzy, feel-good romance, but it's well-executed and does exactly what it needs to. The stuff set in L. A. is more interesting simply because it's ever-so-slightly less conventional, but it still hits pretty much all the beats you'd imagine (yet is no less successful because of it). Kate Winslet and Jack Black aren't really given enough time for their relationship to blossom and, as such, it isn't all that believable they'd fall for one another. There's a scene where Kate Winslet is acting her heart out during an eloquent and sentimental speech about how broken she feels and then Jack Black just swears, says ""you need this more than I do"" in the most Jack Black way possible and hands her a drink. Still, it's a nice enough dynamic that it doesn't feel especially jarring when they inevitably come together as the finale approaches. That's kind of the best way to describe the piece as a whole really; it's a bit rough around the edges and entirely too safe, but it all comes together surprisingly nicely. It's a good version of a generic, slightly unbelievable thing. There are a handful of chucklesome moments, a few pieces of successful sentimentality and a general formal competence that keeps you engaged despite an often uneven and slightly strange pacing. It's definitely too long, but it's also enjoyable enough for what it is. It also serves as a decent movie to watch towards the end of the year, as it starts around Christmas and ends on New Years Eve.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

There's something so soothing and calming effect this movie has without being overly cheesy or dramatic like most of the holiday rom-coms.\nThe writing, the direction, the screenplay AND the acting, everything so perfectly in sync. Never felt bored for a minute. And the dialogues are so well written, nothing felt forced, they were just flowing with the pace.\nComing to the cast and their performances, a lot of ppl say Cameron Diaz was just doing what she has been doing in most of her movies, but as i haven't watched much of her movies, i thoroughly enjoyed her here. But what stood out for me is a Jude Law, a Kate Winslet and a Jack Black u don't get to see very often. Most of the time Jude Law/Kate Winslet are seen in serious characters whereas Jack Black in comedy, but here, Jude Law as a rom-com hero was dream come true. And Kate and Jack as two miserable individuals with bad luck in relationships finding each other was a treat to watch, especially Kate.\nLike every other romantic movies, this movie is also about finding the right partner and you don't know u might find it in the most unexpected place !!!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

For a movie buff, it will have several hooks that will keep you glued to the screen waiting for more.\nBut let's not deviate. This double story of love and heartbreak contains many elements with which the audience can identify, and it is precisely where the film finds its place.\nThe performances of the choral cast are quite dissimilar, with one pair standing out over the other. Winslet and Law knew how to integrate perfectly into their roles, but Diaz and Black didn't.\nThe soundtrack and the meta-narrative details are an excellent complement, which entertain and become part of the essence of the story.\nThe main negative points, in my opinion, are not minor. Direction and editing have quite noticeable errors that at certain points manage to take you out of the natural flow of the plot. Everything else is of a fairly decent level, without standing out in a good or bad way.\nThe film entertains, excites and makes you believe in love.\nRecommended as a good alternative to watch at the end of the year festivities.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

She plays her role in a correspondingly differentiated way, sometimes with a little too much verve, whereas Cameron Diaz falls down considerably, even if she is so likeable that you quickly forgive her for it. In addition to Jack Black's renewed attempt to play a serious role without any antics - which he once again fails to do - Jude Law makes for a clear 2:0 in the Brits versus Yanks comparison. He plays the mischievous father of two adorable little girls so charmingly that you can't help but be thrilled by his first appearance. So Nancy Myers - with a few clever cameo appearances - doesn't light a comedy fire, but a thoroughly likeable story with lots of artificial snow and an Eli Wallach in a great supporting role that goes straight to the heart. All's well that ends well.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

This movie tells parallel stories of two women (Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) each both having freshly coming out of heartbroken relationships. Overcome with emotions, they impetuously decide to swap homes across the the globe to getaway and have a holiday. Unexpectedly for them, love and romance ensures. It is refreshing to see a story told from a woman's perspective. We see portrayed very sensitively the various emotions that women feel as they experience events in their life. E.g. The joys and the sorrows, the anguish and the excitement and everything in-between. Women are emotional beings more so than men.\nMoreover, this film explores the themes of romantic interpersonal relationships, dating and love. It is a movie for young adults who want to watch a movie about romantic love, heartbreak and finding new love. The winds of change is in the air for these heartbroken souls as their destiny of finding love unfolds. What I like about this movie is that universal themes of love and romance are explored in this movie, themes we all desire and can relate to. E.g. We see the flirting glances of budding new love, to dating and getting to know someone, how the guy makes a move and kisses her, how he makes her laugh, to boldly confessing feelings to one another. We also see how the movie explores the idea of long-distance relationships and potential complications that go with that.\nAlso, it is interesting how we form mental pictures of people in our minds based on snap judgements on how they behave or act. Only for the mental picture to reverse and change once we get to know them better. E.g. We may think a guy is hitting on a girl when he is just saying hello. Or how a guy appears to be greeting his girlfriend when he is meeting his sister. This film touches on this play of perceptions.\nHaving watched a few romantic movies, this movie reminds me slightly of the email correspondence in You've Got Mail as the women exchange emails with one another. There is a subtle homage to the film When Harry Met Sally when Cameron Diaz's character meets her love interest (I won't spoil it). The film also features a classic romantic scene where a person realizes the errors of their ways and starts running after their lover filled with passion.\nAll in all, I recommend this as a solid romantic movie with a Christmas theme that will definitely put you into a feel-good romantic mood by the end of it. An enjoyable watch and highly recommended!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

My girlfriend laughed like a hyena every time Cameron Diaz opened her mouth while I was shaking my head wondering what on earth I see in her.. Best Christmas movie ever made she said, I maintain this title belongs to Home Alone but she insisted I was wrong.. I wasn't.\nOnly tolerable part of this movie was the background music. Can't go wrong with Hans Zimmer. And the Dustin Hoffman cameo caught me slightly off guard.. And Cameron Diaz is a horrible actor.. She would never get acting jobs if she wasn't pretty and we all know it.\nCategorizing this as a Christmas movie is an insult to Christmas movies. It's a chick flick and that's all it is.

Sentimental movies, double for Christmas movies probably, package maybe the last fairytale into romance and holiday ""spirit"". The ones that are successful, I find, tend to play into it more. These people don't have communication problems and deep seated psychological issues, they just need a push to tell people how they feel and break a particular pattern.\nBut that's why they're so appealing. Everyone has a pattern that needs breaking and so every character is simultaneously mythic beyond belief and relatable. Coupled with the spirit of the holiday, telling people how you feel and enjoying the company of others, and you have some harmless sentimentality that is divorced from real life and grounded in it, making it an enduring message.\nOf course it's unbelievable. What genre really is? It's all about messaging and trappings.

The plot revolves around two recently single women seeking a vacation to reset their lives. They discover an app for home swaps and decide to exchange houses, embarking on a journey to kickstart their new lives, and surprisingly, it exceeds their expectations.\nWritten and directed by Nancy Meyers (It's Complicated), the film stars Kate Winslet (Titanic), Cameron Diaz (The Mask), Jude Law (Sherlock Holmes), Jack Black (Nacho Libre), and Rufus Sewell (Dark City).\nThe storyline is clever, featuring great settings, unique characters with interesting backstories, and entertaining circumstances. The cast is well-chosen, although Jack Black feels a bit out of place. The rest of the cast is excellent. The film's attire is top-notch, and everyone's outfits are particularly noteworthy. The movie delves into relatable emotions and mental hurdles as characters navigate important life decisions, creating realistic situations with a magical ending.\nIn conclusion, The Holiday is a unique and worthwhile holiday romantic comedy that I strongly recommend.

6595b4e1a783f0cdafc9b357,tt15434074,Kho Gaye Hum Kahan,yashhraaj,3 January 2024,10,"""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" (translating to 'Where are we lost'), directed by Arjun Varain Singh in his directorial debut, is a poignant coming-of-age drama that eloquently captures the essence of modern youth navigating life in the digital age. This 2023 Indian Hindi-language film, streaming on Netflix, delves into the intricacies of friendships, ambitions, and heartbreaks, set against the bustling backdrop of Mumbai.\nThe film, written by Singh, Zoya Akhtar, and Reema Kagti, stars Siddhant Chaturvedi, Ananya Panday, and Adarsh Gourav as the central trio - Ahana, Neil, and Imaad. Their performances are a standout, portraying the complexities of their characters with a raw and relatable intensity. Kalki Koechlin, Anya Singh, and Rohan Gurbaxani, in supporting roles, add depth to the narrative.\nOne of the film's striking aspects is its initial slow pace, which gradually builds up, mirroring the uncertainties and explorations of youth. This pacing beautifully complements the storyline, providing stability and depth to the narrative as it unfolds.\nThe background score by Sid Shirodkar and the songs by a diverse group of artists like OAFF-Savera, Ankur Tewari, and Sachin-Jigar, among others, harmonize with the film's theme. While the songs may be just okay for some, they subtly underscore the film's emotional landscape.\nA significant strength of ""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" is its realistic portrayal of the insecurities faced by today's generation, amplified by the omnipresence of social media. The film does an excellent job of reflecting these contemporary challenges without losing the timeless nature of youth's quest for identity and connection.\nThe drama and romance in the film are finely tuned to resonate with current societal norms and situations, making it particularly relatable to the younger audience. It captures the essence of how relationships and aspirations are influenced and sometimes complicated by the digital world.\nIn summary, ""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" is a well-crafted film that offers a compelling exploration of the journey of self-discovery in the age of social media. It's a narrative that speaks to the heart of the young and the young at heart, making it a recommended watch. The movie, with its excellent cast, thoughtful direction, and relevant storytelling, is a meaningful addition to the genre of modern coming-of-age dramas.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Dialogue, in typical bollywood fashion is shallow in most places, this could've easily been a 9 if it had good dialogue. A lot of subplots lead nowhere, but it doesn't feel too pointless because there is a central theme: the disconnect that stems from social connections.\nThe casting is perfect, Siddhant Chaturvedi is charismatic and his performance comes across as emotionally mature. Adarsh Gaurav immerses himself into his character, and plays the role with strong conviction. Ananya Panday does her best when she plays herself, and she absolutely fit her role, couldn't have imagined someone else in her place.\nOverall, a solid take on GenZ frienships, ambitions, confrontations.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

What's even more surprising is that Ananya Pandey gave quite a convincing performance as Ahana.\nLike DCH and ZNMD, KGHK explores the relationship and trials and tribulations of a group of friends. But, it does not feel like a rip-off of those cult classic films. This film has an individuality which helps it to stand on its own.\nThe movie realistically portrays the shallowness of this hedonistic generation through the stories of its trio of friends. The need for online validation, the want for unnecessary things, the absence of emotional intimacy in relationships, the insecurities, the loneliness; it's a mature depiction of these traits. Cannot remember the last time a Bollywood movie addressed these insecurities in such a beautiful manner. And the leading trio of actors do an amazing job in bringing these things to the screen.\nLoved the flow and pacing of the film. The story was quite good, and will resonate with a huge part of the youth who try to find temporary happiness and validation amidst the deception of social media. The stand-up comedy scenes of Imaad were my favourite in the film, not because they were funny, but because how well those scenes captured the essence and themes of the movie.\nWe are so addicted to looking at our screens that we forgot to look into ourselves.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Imaad fears intimate relationship, Ahana is desperate for her ex's approval and Neil is insecure about his social status. The film takes us through their ups and downs, as they learn to stand up for themselves.\nI did wanted to joke about how the Farhan Akhtar - Zoya Akhtar duo has the same variation script revolving around three friends, a clash among two leaving the third one helpless and eventually they all make up. This time, the script offers a lot more through these characters with Adarsh Gourav and Ananya Panday stealing the show with their respective performances. Even Siddhanth Chaturvedi catches up with a good act. The issues the trio goes through remains highly relatable and that helped to get instantly invested in the story.

I'm a single guy in his late twenties. With that being said I really really liked this film a lot. This is how romantic/dramas should be made. None of the cheesy over the top and obviously fantastical love stories. That actually makes me despise a lot of romantic films because they are in no way realistic or relatable. ""Past Lives"" has to be one of the most real and emotionally gripping films made! At a lot of points during this film I thought I was watching a documentary and the actors weren't actors but real people. That to me is a testament to how good the writing, directing and acting is. If you are achieving that sort of performance and vibe, that transcends film!\nOne of the biggest achievements of this film is the time jumps that happen throughout. A bold strategy to tell a story however it nailed the landing and then some. In a lot of ways elevated and gave a more emotional punch to the story and characters. You 100% feel the journey they had been on! Fantastic writing!\nThis does give me hope that this film should gain word of mouth and hopefully be opened up to more mainstream audiences. However I wonder would it be so real that they wouldn't enjoy it? Much like the film itself offering up so many more questions about life, people, love and relationships. It is a really thought provoking film.\nI must mention quickly Greta Lee who is simply sublime in this film. I mean to be honest everyone is however she carries the story/film so well. A lot of scenes where there is such little dialogue are the most powerful due to her intricate performance.\n80% out of 100!

I recognize that this film is not a masterpiece but we must recognize its value as a romantic comedy where friendship reigns supreme and where the moral, even if classic, is developed in a very beautiful way.

6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b36c,tt15671028,No Hard Feelings,MoxxiProductions,2 January 2024,8,"I'd heard about the nudity in No Hard Feelings before I heard about the actual movie, so I wasn't necessarily expecting a laugh out loud comedy as I assumed the nudity was the actual selling feature. I was wrong.\nIn this day & age, sex & nudity isn't hard to access but good comedy is definitely rare. I'm definitely at the age (57) where I really just want to be entertained and laugh. After I saw the trailer, my expectations grew; Jennifer Lawrence IS naturally funny and quick witted in real life (from the interviews I've seen) and she definitely has developed strong comedy chops. Needless to say they are on full display in No Hard Feelings and I'd hope to see her do more films like this. Lawrence paired with Aubrey Plaza, Melissa McCarthy, Kristin Wiig, Tina Fey etc would be dynamite, as long as Fey & co wrote the script.\nThe farfetched premise, rich helicopter parents want to hire a girl to turn their shy, nerdy introverted son into a ""man"" so he can gain some confidence before college, is as outlandish & somewhat predictable as it is thin, but this isn't a documentary so just go with it.\nAt this stage of her career, Lawrence certainly doesn't have to do nudity but she does it on her terms and it's classic. Not going to spoil it. Andrew Barth Feldman who plays the hapless & love lost Percy is the perfect stooge against Lawrence's cougar-esque Maddie. Percy's dad, Laird, played by Matthew Broderick, & Laura Benanti as Allison, Percy's mom, are a tad one dimensional but they're there to provide the premise with the macguffin being a used Buick, but it works. Former SNL's Kyle Mooney's cameo provides a lot of chuckles and he certainly left me wanting more.\nThe comedy heavily relies on Lawrence trying to be sexy but coming off way too strong. That's not to say Lawrence isn't sexy, of course she is, but it's how that level of female sexual aggressiveness just doesn't land with the Minecraft & Fortnite generation, no matter how many Rule 34 videos they've watched based on their favourite animated shows. They're woefully under prepared for that level of hotness...and therefore hilarity ensues. And it actually does! The plot attempts to give the characters more emotional depth by revealing their backstory's which succeeds to a degree. It's not entirely heavy-handed thank goodness which could have thrown the balance if the movie off.\nThere's laughs and heart to bring the story to its completion and I'm not going to lie, I felt a post-credit scene set in the future would have been nice. All in all, a nice surprise and from what I can remember one of the best comedy's in recent memory. Come for the nudity, stay for the laughs!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Typically I watch Action, Thrillers, that type of stuff but don't mind a rom-com once in a while. However, from the rom-coms I've seen, this comes in at the bottom tier. The storyline did have a potential of coming out better than it did but the casting other than JLaw was atrocious. JLaw did play a semi-decent role in this movie. The movie seemed rushed at times and some of the scenes seemed very dull. I feel like there wasn't a good enough steady tone throughout the movie and just felt bland at times.

6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b36e,tt15671028,No Hard Feelings,xOEryn,29 December 2023,1,"We all remember the obnoxious little thing we did with our siblings and friends as kids. The thing that happened just as some game ended with someone being upset about something- just before a parent got called. The victim of childish misdeeds would ask to not be touched but in an attempt to save face and rebel against being reprimanded by a peer, the offender would hover their hand just near enough to be annoying and say, ""I'm not touching you.""\nGene Stupnitsky and John Phillip's ""No Hard Feelings"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman play this game of ""I'm not touching you"" with sexual impropriety. I dare not use the p-word, lest this becomes an allegation. Nevertheless, despite the chance to see our forever Katniss Everdeen in her most hilarious role since ""Don't Look Up"" we were made to grimace at all the scenes where our writers and director bring us to the brink of what, in our real world, would be a sexual misconduct case, and then says, ""I'm not touching you,"" in that same mischief-ridden way we did as kids before we knew better.\nAs I watched, I fought the temptation to find something on my phone to focus on. I began to obsess about how old the actor who portrayed Percy was in real life because maybe he was a young-in-the-face 30-year-old, and maybe that would make me feel less complicit in the normalization of inappropriate relationships for sporadically laughing.\nI fought the idea of being that person who couldn't just see something and let it be what it is without turning it into something it wasn- and that's when I realized it. It wasn't me turning it into something it wasn't. It already was that something.\nIn recent years, men in the industry have caught hell (rightfully so) with the Me Too Movement, where their misdeeds caught up to them in staggering numbers of people speaking out about the discomfort and straight-up pain they've been made to feel in their work environments.\nThe one true error in the movement was all of the women who weren't called to the carpet for their crimes because young men are socialized to wear attention from older women as a badge pinned to the sash of their manhood.\nWhat I expected from this film was a fresh take on 2006's showdown between Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey in Failure to Launch.\nWhat I got was; ""let's forcefully deflower an awkward, traumatized teenager. But let's make it be because his parents are asking,"" so that I'm not touching you.\n""And then after she fails to sexually assault him properly, he'll start to like her, then it will be consensual,"" so still, I'm not touching you.\n""and then let's make sure they never actually do it because that would actually be improper and probably get us canceled"" I'm definitely not touching you.\n""But it's cool if they get naked in his childhood bed with his parents in the other room, then he'll actually attempt to do the deed but it won't count because, in his inexperience, he didn't realize it was just her thigh"" haha I'm not touching you!\nLet's do the thing where we reverse the roles. Had it been a 30+-year-old man and a 19- year-old high school girl, phones would be ringing, think pieces would be written, and everyone behind the project would be proverbially chased by an angry mob.\nThe thing is if I told you the story of 32-year-old Maddie Barker and 19-year-old Percy Becker without the lights, cameras, and the Oscar-winning actress, you'd cringe. Love to the comedic stylings of Jennifer Lawrence but, why does the big screen loosen our scruples?",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

She doesn't need to take her clothes off and do uncomfortably 'sexy' scenes like the trashy exploitative nude scenes in this movie. They were just gratuitous in my view. The movie could (and I think should) have been made just as well, or better, without forcing her to get nekkid like that. No-one else was nude or eroticised in that way. But I guess that's just what young women in Hollywood still have to do to earn a crust. What happened to #MeToo ?\nIt reminded me of the uncomfortable strip tease scene in True Lies. I felt embarrassed, both then and now, watching Jamie-Lee Curtis having to go through that when it could have been handled much less erotically (even though, in that one she kept the skimpy bikini on).

In this case, not so much. You feel even more lost and lonely after this. For a few reasons.\nLet me backtrack a little. It's wild to believe this garbage was written by the brilliant Emma Thompson. And it took her a decade to come up with the concept. Which was based on a Wham! Tune. Which happens to be one of my favorite Christmas tunes. Listen to the lyrics closely would never have me think the outcome of this flick is about a woman with a heart ailment (something hammered down with words, but not necessarily shown through action) that gets a transplant and lives her life recklessly. Perhaps it was the casting of imp Emilia Clarke that lost it for me. She isn't convincing as a self destructive Yugoslavian. She's saying all the right words but dancing a different tune. Some people aren't meant for physical comedy and she falls under this category. Perhaps a young Drew Barrymore could pull this off. For some reason, every pratfall and delivered line was a colossal miss. MAYBE, it was the writing. I mean, you can see the words on the script pages. MAYBE, it was director Paul Feig that phoned this one in. Because every line is a wheezy fail. Poor Michelle Yeoh who slings out English slang as if she were given line reads by a 15 year old teen girl. Oof.\nSo the conceit will pay off (sort of) when the truth is revealed. Because the love interest of Henry Golding makes zero sense. She, somehow, falls for the dude a little too quick. And the story relies heavily on the immediacy to be something you try to re-watch to see how their relationship would even work.\nThe entire movie feels hollow. It wants you to feel a certain way. But there isn't enough character development to make it work. For instance, the mysterious Golding doesn't allow enough background to make his reveal seem so moving. In fact, it feels tragic when it should feel buoyant. They want this to be a romantic comedy, but none of it hits. Including Emma Thompson (as Clarke's Mom) painfully vomit out a caricature character. It's painful to sit through.\nLook, the heart (literally) is in the right place. However, what makes it exceptionally weird is to have the entire needle drop soundtrack also have George Michael be the Greek chorus of what is happening in her life. Remarkable that the amount of music would've cost this production the cost of the production itself. In a ironic way, the death of George Michael is a dark cloud that should be more of a celebration of his music. Given the poor execution on all levels, it seems much more depressing. This would include veteran lenser John Schwartman's waste of romantic lighting of London during Christmas time. For something which is suppose to glow, seems generically digital and cheap. Sad times.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Title of the movie was a big hit song by WHAM, but George Michael's fabulous voice gave me chills. The myriad songs sung by George Michael fit in nicely with the plot. The movie moved along with twists and turns that fit beautifully with the London street views. Loved the Christmas decorations and light displays. Overall, a surprise ending...a movie with a soft message. The actors, in my opinion, were cast appropriately and delivered a stellar performance without being a corny Ron-Con snooze-fest. Seeing Andrew Ridgeley in a cameo shot at the end was nice, as his friendship and collaboration with the late George Michael was fabulously successful.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Of course, the great Emma Thompson being involved not only as a writer but in the movie as well probably played a large part, but the two leads, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were spot on. I truly don't understand the overall low ratings, I would expect this to be 7.5-8 here on IMDb. Maybe the mystical aspect was over the top for a lot of people? Maybe a lot of people don't like George Michael's music which was played throughout the movie?

The main character learns how to love, and love herself. Which is a nice turn from some traditional Christmas love stories. But THAT is not the surprise ending that I mentioned before. If you stay till the end, you will see that a lot of thought was put into the story line and that all is not what it seems. I would say that the unexpected turn of events was a huge determining factor in my high rating of this movie. It was jaw dropping, really, and in my opinion, a really good movie.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,
6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b388,tt8623904,Last Christmas,OneAnjel,3 December 2023,3,"... then watch this film. A lot of people have seen the lead actress in other shows or films but I am not familiar with her. All I can tell you is that I'm sure she acted as the Director asked her to, but having said that her character was insufferable. There's no other word for it. When Lucille Ball Falls over a couch and crushes someone's labored work of art it's funny as hell, but when Emelia's character topples over a couch and crushes something after violating her friendship and the friends compassion by actually bringing sexual mates into the flat it's just not funny at all. No one would put up with that from a teenager never mind from a grown woman.\nOne of the reviews said that she thinks if there were little kids in the room maybe she could have enjoyed the film but I'm just wondering if she means because she thought little kids should be watching this horrible PG-13 excuse for a Christmas film. There's a reason it's pg-13, it is not for little children.\nI found the character to be absolutely vile and how she made it that far in life is beyond belief. The idea that a talented attractive young man would even be interested in a homeless promiscuous chubby fake blonde can only be written into a film because it doesn't really happen. I came here to read the reviews about halfway through to decide if I want to finish the film, and although there are many accolades there are also many people who feel the same way I do. The film itself was in bad taste, using George Michael's famous Christmas song as a backdrop for this bumbling idiot is an insult to George Michaels. If the film plans to save itself, it's taking way too long and I'm done.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

They don't need or want marriage or kids. Their friends and family judge them for this even though they are happy. By the end they are peer pressured despite all the evidence proving their stance to be correct to conform to the norm.\nThe comedy may not be to everyone's taste though I enjoyed it. Though after the second christmas it felt like they started to speedrun the story with the third christmas being short and the fourth practically nonexistent. I could see how the movie was going to end by the halfway point but it still pissed me off. I have never been so angry at an xmas movie.

This movie does a decent job at showcasing their relative talents. There are a number of memorably funny scenes at the various Christmas celebrations they attend when their plane gets delayed. Robert Duvall and Jon Favreau are very funny in the limited scenes they are in. Mary Steenburgen is very likable and well utilized. Krista Cheneworth has some funny scenes. Dwight Yokum is good. The movie has some sentimental rom/com moments. The Nativity Play is the best part part. The movie just doesn't do a great job in tying it all together.

6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b38b,tt0369436,Four Christmases,JayWolfgramm,25 December 2023,4,"This movie makes it clear pretty early on exactly how the story is going to play out. We have our two main characters, played by Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn, who don't like spending time with their family for Christmas. The character arc that the two are going to go through becomes apparent very early on. As the title implies, the couple go to four different family Christmases. The first two Christmases are so over the top and detached from reality that the movie loses any relatability with the audience.\nThe jokes do not land, and when they don't, they linger on them for way too long. It's like they'll tell the joke, and then repeat the same thing with 4 different punchlines. The bickering couple routine gets old really fast, and no one would believe Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon as a couple.\nBut, with all that said, the movie is harmless enough. It gives you exactly what the premise promises. And it manages to do it all in under 90 minutes. It maybe fourgetable, but I'll fourgive it, and I'll give it a 4 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,
6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b38c,tt0369436,Four Christmases,ryanpersaud-59415,14 December 2023,7,"Four Christmases is WAY better than I remembered it being. I think people dismiss this movie because of the puke jokes, the crass ""Southern working class"" stereotypes, the kids hitting and jumping on adults. I get it. But I'd argue all of that is window dressing - attempts to keep this film as a comedy - rather than the ""point"" of the movie.\nFour Christmases - stay with me here - is a meditation on family, relationships, and Christmas. Unlike so many other films, this one has a more grounded take than I expected: family isn't perfect, Christmas doesn't solve all of the problems, sometimes family members are just bad for you to be around and maybe, it's okay to acknowledge that. But, with all of this in mind, family grounds us; they're people we don't choose to be around, but people we're around because we all need people in our lives who will be with us, no matter how different we are. There's something special about connecting with a person who isn't ""exactly"" like you and finding something to appreciate.\nI really like the ethos of this movie; that this no-it all, protypical liberal couple - Vaughn and Witherspoon - realize that for all their freedom, they don't have the depth of connection their family members do; all their condescension and status flies out the window. Yeah, this movie is deeper than you probably remember.\nIt's also pretty funny, with some really standout jokes and actors who are generally really great. John Favreau is a scene stealer, playing so far away from type, it's a joy every time he's on screen. Kristin Chenoweth is solid as well, but come on...Sissy Spacek? Robert Duvall? John Voight? Mary Steenburgen? This cast is stacked with legends who do an amazing job and give the film a ""ghosts of Christmas"" vibe with how different they all are. Oddly enough, I think Vaughn and Witherspoon are fine here; really anyone could've played these characters, and it's the other actors who make this movie for me.\nIs this movie predictable? A little silly? A bit low brow? Sure. Is it fun? Yes. Does it have heart? Yes. It's a solid Christmas comedy and I think I'd recommend it to basically anyone looking for some laughs with their cheer.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,
6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b38d,tt0369436,Four Christmases,silverpinkcity,8 December 2023,2,"I watched this movie once before and just decided yesterday, for the heck of it, to watch it again. Big mistake! Now I know why I told myself, ""Don't watch this thing again!"" the last time I watched it.\nWith all the big names in this movie, you'd think it would be a lot better. But it's not! This is one of the most ""UNChristmasy"" Christmas movie around! Just...yuck! And why is that? Well, it could be that this movie is chock-full of incredibly mean-spirited and unlikable people...which doesn't make for the best holiday fuzzy wuzzy feelings. Not that I like Hallmark-style sappiness. But this is just the opposite extreme.\nIn the movie, Reese Witherspoon's character and Vince Vaughn's character are a couple who want desperately to be ""untraditional."" No marriage...no babies...no families at Christmas. (And yes, both of their parents are divorced...hence the ""four Christmases"" we end up being subjected to). This couple makes up elaborate excuses as to why they cannot visit their parents and respective families on the holidays. They claim they are ""helping orphans"" or ""building houses for the poor in some third world country,"" that sort of cliche thing. But really, they are embarking on fun tropical vacays and just enjoying themselves without having to deal with any of that pesky family responsibility stuff. (And after we ""meet"" their families, we sort of understand why they do this).\nWell, one year they get caught at the airport with their lame excuses; the plane is grounded, and they are now forced to go visit their families on Christmas. And hey.....this wouldn't even be such a bad plot! I mean...it has possibilities for depth and humor combined. It really does! However....the movie definitely drops the ball, starting with the very first family the couple goes to visit...Vince Vaughn's father (played by Rober Duval) and his horribly aggressive brothers who are constantly attacking and wrestling and their respective kids and wife and baby, etc...\nThe jokes all fall flat; the families and kids and brothers and father are all just hideous and unlikable...they all jump on Vince Vaughn's character accusing him of being ""weak"" and a ""snob"" and etc...There is lots of over-acting and just flat-out bad acting and everything is overdone and over-the-top, so it just isn't even believable. The characters are all so one-dimensional. Not a fun experience...not very funny to watch. Okay, maybe there are one or two tiny laughs in the dialogue, but that is not enough!\nThen it's onto the next ""Christmas,"" with Reese Witherspoon's mother (played by Mary Steenburgen) and assorted characters here, like a sister and baby and a minister (the new ""boyfriend"" of the mother) and a horrible little girl, etc... We find out things about Reese Witherspoon's character's past...like she used to be overweight, and everyone thought she had ""cooties."" the family sits around laughing at pictures of Reese as a chubby baby....unbelievable, right? What a terribly mean thing to do! And on Christmas, no less. Not funny! Not funny, at all! Why is being ""mean"" being presented as humor, I wonder?\nThen there is an equally unfunny mean scene in a ""bouncy castle"" with kids acting like evil little bullies...and through-out, there is Reese Witherspoon wondering where her relationship is ""going"" and if indeed she wants children...(and I don't know why she would, after all the horrible children she encounters in this movie).\nThen...it's two more equally unfunny Christmases for us to endure. The one with Sissy Spacek (Vince Vaugn character's mom) and her super young boyfriend is slightly funny...but only slightly. It is here that the two main characters have a fight...and the last Christmas, at Reese's father's house (her father is played by. John Voight...one of the only ""nice"" characters in the whole movie) we see that the Vince Vaugn character doesn't even participate.\nAnd then, folks...it's on to the most cliched ending in movie history!!!! No spoilers here...(yes, you can suffer through this movie to find out the ending, if you have the stomach for it)! Anyway, I will say that Reese Witherspoon did a decent job. So that is why I'm giving the movie two points. All for her! But as for Vince Vaugn....he was so bad! That fast-talking style gets really annoying! And he is downright rude to Reese's character a few times, which in my opinion, makes him a real jerk. So! Do I recommend this movie? Ha! I think it's obvious I emphatically do NOT! However, if you want to watch to just see how bad it is...be my guest! Like I said....the movie had a somewhat decent premise. And yes, there may be a few tiny laughs. But...don't expect anything more!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4d,,,,,

Why not have a comedy Christmas movie revolving around the theme of avoiding your dysfunctional families during the holidays? There are a few legendary scenes in this movie that are totally realistic and hysterical.\nBasically this movie is about rejection of societal expectations and pressures around the holidays.

There is so much psychoanalysis going on between Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn back-and-forth and it's all about relationships, and the depth of true love. Take all the weird and silly comedy and put it aside, and you have a magnificent love story between two people who are young-ish well to do, actually quite snooty and standoffish, yet endearing. When I think about the accolades this movie deserves, I hesitate for a moment, and, as I pause to reflect upon the hidden gem that 'Four Christmases' is, I realize that it's obviously not the most popular film. On the other hand, it's always popping up on this or that platform, it's obvious that millions of people love it and maybe they just won't admit it. I am here to say this is a great movie, all the elements proclaim: ""instant classic"" you have to see this. I think this is my fifth time.

While it offers almost the same number and quality of shirtless scenes as in the original ""A California Christmas,"" his chest is way overly clipped here and he almost looks smooth. The original CC showed him off at his most hirsute and he looked great.

6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b39c,tt1160419,Dune: Part One,raoul-naegele,1 January 2024,7,"It's definitely a good movie, generally well executed and true to the book. But since I like nitpicking, here are some critical remarks:\nPacing is WAY too slow. Every scene takes far too long. Everything is duly explained. The 1984 version was certainly too fast but this time they overcompensated for it.\nSome CGI scenes, especially the desert ones, look too clean and too clear, with no blurriness or grittiness. This gives the impression of it having been filmed in a TV studio.\nThe Harkonnen lack the deeply sadistical touch of the 1984 version. This makes them appear far less deplorable. There are no really disturbing scenes, which may be because the producers wanted to avoid a 18+ rating.\nThe race and gender swaps of some characters are unnecessary but not too irritating because it just a SF/fantasy movie, not a historical drama after all.\nThere are no pugs, anywhere.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

6595b4e2a783f0cdafc9b39e,tt1160419,Dune: Part One,fernandoschiavi,30 December 2023,8,"Since they were published in 1965, Frank Herbert's books have inspired the creation of worlds like those of ""Star Wars"" and ""Game of Thrones"", which means that this return to the original story is nothing new, but something extremely familiar. Thus, without the novelty factor, director Denis Villeneuve bets on the grandeur of this universe as a differentiator and presents an epic like we haven't seen in cinema for a long time. Everything in ""Dune"" is big, imposing and impactful.\nWritten by Eric Roth, Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve himself, ""Dune: Part One"" introduces us to Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, who in the year 10,191 have their rivalry accentuated when Emperor Shaddam IV removes the latter from control of the planet Arrakis and the transfers the first time - something significant, since Arrakis is the only source of extraction of a substance whose value is inestimable. However, the Emperor's decision is not driven by favoritism towards the Atreides; on the contrary, he fears the popularity of Duke Leto Atreides (Isaac) and hopes that the transfer to the new planet will leave him vulnerable to an attack by his enemy, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard). Meanwhile, the Duke's son, young Paul (Chalamet), has been having visions that result from the powers inherited from his mother, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), a member of an ancient order made up of women who secretly orchestrate events in the Empire - and these Visions reveal that the boy may be the Chosen One prophesied millennia ago.\nOnce again, there's no denying the awesomeness of Dune. Knowing that there was no way to innovate in terms of story and themes, Villeneuve bet all his chips on visual impact - and he succeeded. Dune is visually a spectacle even with its washed-out colors: the contrast between the planet Caladan (home of the Atreides) and Arrakis is remarkable, while Gledi Prime, planet of the Harkonnen, evokes a nightmare. Furthermore, the scale of the buildings - especially on Arrakis - is oppressive, rendering the humans (or humanoids) who inhabit them insignificant. To top it off, the costumes range from ceremonial ostentation to the practicality of life in the desert with creativity, managing to achieve verisimilitude without taking away from the fantasy. In this sense, it is also important to note the influences embraced by costume designer Jacqueline West, who adopts, for example, an aesthetic clearly inspired by Arab culture that, not by chance, mirrors Frank Herbert's own sources when conceiving the people of Arrakis.\nVisiting each of the planets is a truly impactful experience and everything is done to dazzle the viewer, from the construction of each scenario to the design of the ships, which take your breath away when they fill the entire screen. There is enormous care in this production work, ensuring that each house has its own identity, giving the feeling that the universe is truly vast and that each people is unique. But all this attention to detail takes time. Of the 2h40 film, an hour and a half are dedicated just to showing how things work, what houses are, the dynamics of the Empire, the importance of spice and the role of the planet Akarris in imperial geopolitics. He is entirely concerned with establishing his universe and, only after that, begins to tell his story. The problem is that, when this happens, the film comes to an end. Not intending to present the universe in its entirety, which would make the film very confusing, the script chose to introduce characters, basic concepts and establish the aesthetics of the saga. Of course, there is no conclusion, but there is no need for it. The film is honest and makes it clear at the beginning that it is the first part of a story. The point at which ""Dune (2021)"" ends is precisely when a change occurs in Paul's character.\nFeaturing a notable cast that includes everyone from Charlotte Rampling to Zendaya (who has little to do other than serve as an ambiguous promise of love and violence for the protagonist), Dune has the luxury of featuring Javier Bardem in two or three scenes, Stellan Skarsgard practically unrecognizable under tons of prosthetics and Charlotte Rampling herself hidden by an almost impenetrable black veil). On the other hand, Jason Momoa gives charisma to the warrior Duncan Idaho, complementing Josh Brolin's (correctly) dry composition, while Oscar Isaac brings dignity and firmness to Duke Leto, which leads the viewer to recognize the difference between his House and that of the Harkonnens, even though both work to explore Arrakis. However, the most striking performances are those offered by Rebecca Ferguson and Sharon Duncan-Brewster: while the first evokes the ambivalence she experiences when recognizing the potential Chosen One in her son, demonstrating rigidity and affection in equal measure, the second transforms Dr. Liet Kynes in a figure who, already damaged by decades of exploration, hesitates to trust in the integrity of the Atreides, helping them when he deems it necessary, but making it clear that his pride and concern for the Fremen will always come first. To conclude, Timothée Chalamet embodies Paul with the intensity possible for a character who, let's be honest, is more archetype than individual - and if the boy often seems inexpressive, this is more due to the narrative function that the hero performs than to any another thing.\nBut this negative aspect of not delving as much into the characters is also, in an incongruous way, one of the film's strengths and one that shows the production's courage. On the one hand, we have a series of characters who don't gain enough development for us to truly care about their fates, but, on the other, they work together like the living organism that pulses around Paul and Jessica, allowing These two have the spotlight pointed at them, creating all the necessary infrastructure for them to grow and for us to see this fascinating new world through them. When Dune ends and Chani, looking at mother and son (and, sideways, also at us), says, in all words, that ""this is just the beginning"", we realize that Villeneuve has fulfilled his mission of introducing us, building and developing the three main foundations of the expansive epic that Herbert's work required, something that perhaps shifting focus to the rest of the cast would not have made possible. The director carefully sacrificed several elements and characters - it may seem like the adaptation is exaggeratedly faithful, but the truth is that the adaptation work was extensive, with a lot of things being left out - in order to focus on what was truly important.\nInterestingly, however, especially considering the length of the film and what lies ahead, some character exclusions are surprising. House Corrino, of Emperor Shaddam IV, is not present except through emissaries. The navigators, who pilot the ships on interplanetary journeys, are not seen. Feyd Rautha, another nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Skarsgård), is not even mentioned. The gigantic sandworms, which are the real terror of those who want to extract spice, but, on the other hand, are gods for the native Fremen people, are only partially seen in a very interesting decision by Villeneuve, certainly to leave us with water in our mouths. Mouth. These absences, which, of course, will only be felt even by those who have read the book, are replaced by a bit of necessary expository text, notably through the protagonist's studies with tape recorders and visual aids and, above all, through contemplation, with Paul slowly, but clearly understanding his path and what he needs to do, with the cadence of events determined by Villeneuve's careful decoupage never allowing that feeling of confusion.\n""Dune"" is, in essence, a political-religious allegory with environmental concerns that are reflected in the way the rich and powerful Houses feel entitled to invade Arrakis in order to extract its natural resources, ignoring the needs of the native Fremen (""free men""; it is not necessary to be subtle to be effective) and the way in which they integrate with nature in an organic and non-destructive way. Thus, if the substance coveted by the empire is a powdered version of oil, the Fremen display clear traces of Arab nations and Islam in their clothes, their language and some of their customs, and it is admirable to see how Herbert (and, consequently, Villeneuve) reverses the habitually prejudiced view with which Europe and the United States view those people.\nVilleneuve is one of the great directors of the current generation and he has shown himself to be increasingly adept at the Bene Gesserit mantra that says that fear kills the mind, that it is the small death that leads to annihilation, even experiencing box office failures as unfairly happened with its ""Blade Runner 2049"". His bet with Dune was risky, because, despite being a well-known book, it is a long, hermetic work that relatively few people have actually read and the division into two films is another element that only brings potential complications for the future of the film franchise. However, in the end, as much as this first part of ""Dune"" brings an epic veneer, it slips by not delivering the basics: a story for the audience to connect with. The fantastic world fills the eyes and takes your breath away, but that's not what people relate to and there's no production design that makes people get involved with a story that hasn't even begun. Even though the next chapters are as promising as the future of Paul Atreides, it is first necessary to convince the public to want to cross this desert - and that will be the real challenge. Considering all the choices the director made, especially the boldness of reducing the focus of the gigantic epic to the journey of a young man trying to find his way, it is nothing less than impressive, with chances of the final set being superior to the separate parts.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

Released in 2021, this film is a testament to the power of visual storytelling and the potential of science fiction to explore complex themes.\nTimothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, the young heir to the noble House Atreides. Chalamet delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Paul's transition from a sheltered nobleman to a leader embroiled in a complex interstellar conflict. His portrayal embodies the character's depth, intelligence, and burgeoning sense of destiny.\nThe supporting cast is stellar, with standout performances from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, and Stellan Skarsgård as the menacing Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Each actor brings gravitas and complexity to their roles, enriching the film's expansive narrative.\nVilleneuve's direction is masterful. He crafts a visually stunning world that is both alien and familiar, capturing the grandeur and danger of the desert planet Arrakis. The film's visual effects are not just impressive in their technical execution but are integral to the storytelling, immersing the viewer in the world of ""Dune.""\nThe screenplay, co-written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, remains faithful to Herbert's novel, preserving its political intrigue, philosophical depth, and cultural richness. The film delves into themes of power, destiny, and ecological stewardship, offering a thoughtful exploration of Herbert's ideas.\nHans Zimmer's score is another highlight, providing an atmospheric and immersive soundscape that complements the film's visual splendor. The music is both haunting and epic, enhancing the film's sense of scale and emotional depth.\nHowever, ""Dune"" is not without its challenges. The film's pacing can feel slow at times, focusing more on world-building and atmosphere than on fast-paced action. Additionally, as the first installment of a planned two-part adaptation, the film ends on an open note, which might leave some viewers unsatisfied.\nSome characters and subplots are not as fully developed as they could be, a limitation likely due to the vast scope of the source material and the constraints of a cinematic runtime. This may impact viewers who are not already familiar with the novel.\nIn conclusion, ""Dune"" is a remarkable achievement in science fiction filmmaking. It successfully adapts a famously complex novel into a visually spectacular and narratively engaging film. While it may not fully stand alone as a self-contained story, it sets the stage for an epic saga. Its combination of visual mastery, thoughtful storytelling, and strong performances earn it a well-deserved 8 out of 10.

The baron in the book is a far more complex and interesting character. One who is riddled with doubt, anxiety, and thus cruel to balance these feelings out and overcome his own doubts.

This is one such film. For starters it is very slow to begin and when it does veer off into the first case of alternate universe, if you can call it that, it is just silly. I guess it's a case of Hollywood jumping on a bandwagon and wanting to praise the filmmaker and stars, when really it's all kind of daft. I was reminded of eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind and personally I enjoyed that movie a lot, it just blended the real and the unreal better.

All of that makes it very difficult if not impossible to follow the story. I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with sensory sensitivities.

It starts nowhere and wishes to go anywhere just for the sake of trying absurdist meta verse complications.\nOk so if you are much of a gamer your brain might be rewired to explore all this kind of BS stratified world and thus embrace what the title says. Otherwise, if you are desperately rational in your thinking (and think you should cultivate it for fear of becoming a dumbed down version of yourself, gradually entrusting machines and AI with managing the complexity of life) then the only thing you can see is a big mess originating from some student pet project.\nIn this rational realm people enjoy just being carried away by some brilliantly creative story. But a story is not just whatever mess you can summon to metastasize into anything mixing action and meta-BS.

The best and only way to comprehend this movie is like Michelle Yeoh's character Evelin had tax issues and they all went to the tax office and the extreme pressure there caused Evelin to hallucinate, this hallucination took her through what was popularized as multiverse at random, seeing various things and feeling like she is singer, marshal arts expert, etc. Etc. To make her feel powerful and on the way meeting some very strange people and very strange events. Who knew that in some far away universe buttock plug gave people super powers. When the tax lady finally gave her more time and consideration, Evelin came out of her hallucination and things were great. Somehow these hallucinations give Evelin to realize the meaning of love, and this is the mystery starting with the two stones, somehow that realization was also transferred to others as well, especially her demanding father who never wanted her in the first place.

It is kinda convoluted though on the first watch. It also seems to be a good movie to watch on New Year's Eve time since it takes place on Chinese New Year.

The emotional punches hit you harder than a gravitational pull. The whole survival-of-humanity thing mixed with family drama adds a layer of intensity that's both thrilling and tear-jerking. And that soundtrack? Hans Zimmer nails it, making every scene feel like an epic space opera.\nSure, it's not a flawless 10 because some parts might be a tad confusing, but that's the Nolan touch. 'Interstellar' is like a trip through the cosmos that leaves you questioning the universe and your existence.

The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here\nI'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.\nMatthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.\nI will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really.

There are also too few characters, such that some seem over used, in roles which would be better split, were the script to remain plausible. And overall, it's the script that is poor, not the story.

Performances are delivered with conviction - Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are particularly effective.\nThe negatives: It's very long - not necessarily a problem - but if you make a 3 hour movie it has to sustain interest (and in this case tension) for that period, which, unfortunately, it doesn't. 2 hours in, I really didn't care if mankind survived. Not helped by Mathew McConaughey's slow, mumbled delivery. I guess he was going for intensity, but it doesn't come across that way.\nThe absurdity: The robots are ridiculous - like something out of a 60s Sci-fi serial. The idea that a more advanced society would create something like that is just plain ludicrous. And the depiction of the inside of a black hole and how it helps solve the puzzle is unbelievable in the extreme. To me, it seems like Nolan had no idea how to solve the dilemma he had set. Sure, it's Sci-fi, but unless it's done for comic effect, it still needs at least a veneer of plausibility.

The characters, flattened into two-dimensional self-parodies, are permitted one of two emotional states: mawkish sentimentality, or incongruous fury.\nFlipping between these extreme emotions from scene to scene - and sometimes within a scene - the cast spends the entire film either weeping or yelling at each other. With no dynamic range, there is little room for story arc, though since the plot can be summarised in five words - 'Rocket's creator wants him back' - perhaps that's no bad thing; and no room at all for character development.\nThe result is so bizarre you'd be forgiven for thinking that James Gunn had wandered off set and let an angry adolescent do the directing.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

Director James Gunn has once again worked his magic, delivering a perfect concoction of heart, humour, and intergalactic action that defines the franchise.\nFrom the opening scene to the final credits, the film is a wild ride that never loses momentum. Rocket, voiced by the impeccable Bradley Cooper, takes center stage with a story arc that adds surprising emotional depth to this already beloved character. Gunn explores Rocket's inner struggles, making audiences feel for this CGI raccoon more than some flesh-and-blood beings.\nVisually, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a spectacle. The cosmic landscapes burst with vibrant colours, immersing the audience in a mesmerizing universe filled with strange creatures and breathtaking locales. The action sequences, whether in space or on solid ground, are a visual feast that effortlessly combines thrilling combat with the trademark humor of the Guardians.\nThe chemistry among the cast remains as potent as ever. The familiar faces - Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Karen Gillan - effortlessly slide back into their roles, infusing each character with their unique charm. The introduction of new characters breathes fresh dynamics into the team, enriching the overarching narrative.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 strikes a perfect balance in storytelling, seamlessly blending lighthearted comedy with poignant character development. Themes of family, redemption, and sacrifice are expertly woven into a narrative that keeps you engaged and emotionally invested.\nWhile some may find certain sequences, particularly those involving Rocket, a tad gratuitous given Marvel's family-friendly approach, the film remains a gripping and impactful experience.

Granted, we are presented with characters which we have grown to love so that puts this film at an advantage. However, the most recent installment added to character's depth and continued on storylines created in the previous phase. For this reason, Guardians Vol. 3 stands as one of Marvel's better films. The most striking thing to me is the emotion and feeling the animators and Bradley Cooper were able to bring to a CGI character like Rocket. Honestly one of the more moving performances I've ever seen from voice acting and animation alone. The film left me satisfied as a conclusion to this three-part story. As usual with this franchise, the soundtrack was phenomenal. The comedic performances and the action sequences were all on par with the previous films as well. Some newer characters (Adam Warlock) felt underwhelming but this didn't take away from the overall story. In fact, I loved Poulter's performance and found it quite funny, but the character himself felt unnecessary in the overall story. The villain, The High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji, was one of my favorite villains in the MCU to date.\nOverall, this film should be a delight to anyone who has grown to love the Guardians franchise. If you're not into the MCU films then this probably won't change your view. Otherwise, you will be happy to see the familiar faces and a film that lives up to the high bar that Marvel has set for itself, something a lot of the newer films have failed to do.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

This is at the same time the movie's strength and weakness. This story can get in your feels at moments, but on the other hand the reasons for why things happen remain in shadows. The psychology behind the Bad Guy's actions is not a point of focus. And that doesn't make him mysterious. It makes him shallow and uninteresting: The only thing he seems to be capable of is being angry.\nYou could say, just sit and watch the wild ride and enjoy. But the action itself is somewhat generic and the story rather straightforward. And this time the music and the jokes do not bring this movie to a higher level. The music sometimes felt out of place. The jokes were crammed in because a certain number of jokes had to be in the movie, or so I guess.\nFor a two and a half hour movie the story is simply not well developed enough to the point of being superficial. The interaction between the characters, the dialogue, it wasn't fresh. It didn't sparkle. More of the same. And what about those captive children? That looked so eery. And yet, it added virtually nothing to the story, because nothing was done with this fact. So you see the dark backstory gets flushed out by all the action scenes, making it almost a bit childish. The emotional moments were only there for effect.... No, this is not Star Wars where a perfect balance between fun & serious and dark & light was created.\nIt's not a bad movie though. The visuals are outstanding, There's a lot of action. It has its moments. It' the Guardians with a twist, but that twist makes it less funny and entertaining than the previous movies.

First, as Katniss ascends the tube to the arena, Once (more than once?) when she's in the arena, and once more in the last couple of minutes of the film.\nWe had the same kind of crazed in the latter seasons of Handmaid's Tale; one presumes the directors didn't have a robust imagination for alternatives than ""crazed expression #24"".\nIt's as if the characters, contrary to most reasonable people I think, actually hadn't reached the point of not being surprised by anything that might occur, in spite of all that has occurred to date.\nOtherwise, a very good film, well done all-around.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

That may seem strange as I have only rated a 7 but in truth I'm not sure what I would've wanted, it might just be the fact that this movie is just another part of the story that it can't deliver everything. In my opinion it is much better than the first movie as my only real complaint from that one was that the hunger games action didn't really start until the last hour. Although this film had a similar set up, I found the build up to the return to the games was much more interesting and set up a brilliant and thrilling game.

This film took the best elements from the first film and REALLY expanded upon them.\nThe first film introduced the idea of the games to us, but this film gave us the argument and philosophy of why the games existed in the first place. This film also did a great job with expanding the world of Panem and it's character storytelling.\nAs far as character moments go, there were alot of great moments from both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. Both of them struggling with life after the Games, and how they deal with the\nsavagery they've witnessed while going through another round of even more savagery in this film. Both are at there peak in this film and continue to shine and grow.\nShoutout to Donald Sutherland though. We definitly get to spend more time with him in this film and we really get to see more of what drives him to do what he does, and we get to see some really awesome moments between his character President Snow, and Katniss Everdeen.\nThe imagery and cinematography I believe have really stepped up since the last movie. There were some really beautiful shots. And the music is even more of a standout in this one.\nOther than that, like I said before, the action is a lot more savage than previous, and definitely more faster paced in my opinion. The Choreography and the action scenes were done really well.\nI know people say that this film may be the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, but in my opinion, both the 1st and 2nd could be potentially tied for first in my mind.

The only reason I watch these movies is to get ready for the upcoming one now in November. But about this one. Well, it was just ok. The plot is taking place just after part one, and things are starting to get out of control when Katniss Everdeen is changing the Hunger Games, and starts to make people mad. After that it goes a while and a new Hunger Games is out once again, with the same characters from part one. So honestly, nothing new was changed, just a new game. You know they are going to survive, because it's too predictable. Some new challenges but didn't impress too much. But I have to admit that part two was better made than the original one. The stunts were creative and well done. Great camera-work and epic angles, what gave this an extra cinematic experience. Entertaining for most time, so I give most points for that. They showed a bigger connection between the friend group in the games, but I wished some more character development form the main characters. I also wished they could show more of the world outside, because they haven't showed it so much yet. And the music. Well, The Hunger Games theme is fun to listen, but not for the thousand time. They could put more variety in the music score. The nostalgic and heroic theme was getting my out of control sometimes. But overall, this wasn't such a bad movie. It got some technical and historical problems that I would change, but at the same time it was very entertaining and good action included, with a pretty cool cliffhanger at the end! So if you liked the first one, then you should watch this one, too, but don't have high expectations.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

The steering is one of the points that bothers me the most in the previous one. However, in this second film the screenwriters and director are different. This detail completely changed the quality of the sequel, making it far superior to its predecessor. Even though it's better, it's still nothing incredible and revolutionary. It's a generic film with interesting scenes, but in the end it doesn't become anything memorable. The first act is the most interesting moment and best explores this problematic system in the universe of The Hunger Games. After the first act, we enter again into a dull story that serves as an excuse to become yet another generic action film. There's nothing special about the film, but it manages to be fun at different times.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b3d7,tt1951264,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,mickeythechamp,6 November 2023,6,"And already now the franchise seem to fall apart a bit. While Catching Fire has some better elements than its predecessor, fixing some of my complaints, it starts to add a lot more problems since it's a franchise movie. Not enough time with characters or enough explanation to why character are like they are, and the Hunger Game here is really just a side gig to the new plot, revolution. Some aspects work, while some really don't. I feel like this franchise really got worse from here on, because they don't stand on their own feet as good movies on their own. The first Hunger Games will forever stand on its own while this one is good, it will have symptoms of the middle child.\nAfter her winning of the Hunger Games, a new rebellion is starting. President Snow notices the fans of Katniss and sends her back to a new Hunger Games.\nA performance I forgot to highlight last time was Stanley Tucci as Caesar. He brings so much late night host energy to his role and is no doubt the biggest joy here. The performances are not nearly as great as the first movie and seems more leaned back here. The focus on romance is not helping it, as we didn't spend enough time with the characters in the first movie. A problem that carries over to this movie with a vengeance. Characters are barley here and deaths doesn't hit at all. Sure characters like Finnick add a little, but I felt nothing for these contestants at all.\nThe movie is centered around the revolution aspect more and therefore the Hunger game is not that interesting here. It is showed more to the side with too many alliances and too much interference from the game master. It really makes the movie feel less grand than the original. I will never understand why Katniss turns into this symbol of the rebellion. She barely does anything special in her Hunger Game and after what 75 years? They decide that the capital is evil? I don't understand why Katniss inspires people in this franchise\nSpeaking of Katniss, she looks so weird in this movie! The make-up looks horrendous, and I think this is the only movie where she looks like that. She looks overly dolly in this movie, and it really didn't click with me.\nThe action and the overall shots are so much better directed here. But it also removes something to talk about in terms of the camerawork. The camerawork is just boring now, nothing to really talk about at all, and it feels more stale. Some of the traps are a bit more intense than the original, and I kind of liked that, but this movie is a bit more about the traps than the Hunger Games contestants.\nThis movie uses more time on the romance than the original, but we barely got to know the love interests in the first movie, so it's not really anything worth talking about or adds anything of value.\nThis time around, I find the first half better than the last half, contrary to the original. I wanted the first movie to just start, but the political undertones here are far more interesting than anything going on in the Hunger Game.\nThis is still a fine enough movie and I see it as enjoyable enough and more or less on par with the original. But the original feels more like its own movie and a stand alone, while this one feels like a set-up movie for something bigger. It's a weakness for it, and it will lead to some terrible and mid-movies, but this one is still fine. I see it as a bit more soulless though.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

As Max, the craggy but full-lipped Tom Hardy doesn't look anything like Mel Gibson. It is Theron - or possibly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, playing a sultry breeder called Splendid - who is channelling the eerily beautiful Gibson from 1979, except that probably neither is pretty enough. Fury Road is almost a silent film in it way. Dialogue is at a minimum, and when Max says anything it is usually preceded by an eccentric rumbling, mumbling mmmm sound. He is impassive, to say the least: the nearest Tom Hardy's Mad Max comes to an emotional outburst is when Splendid does something very brave while hanging on to the side of the truck.

Miller's new supercharged, visually stunning reboot is a punk-influenced dystopian vision with an angry feminist streak, it is also a non-stop relentless orgy of brutal violence, death, blood, automotive mayhem peppered with collisions and explosions, as well as unforgettable, adrenaline-pumping, kinetic action sequences that puts to shame every action blockbuster in recent memory! The plot concerns the revenge seeking desert nomad Max Rockatansky, played impressively by Tom Hardy who skillfully takes over the role from Gibson and proves to be a worthy successor. Max is roped into helping a one-armed, steely-eyed, badass female protagonist named Furiosa, played magnificently by Charlize Theron in a scene-stealing performance. She has escape with five young women from the clutches of Immortan Joe, a fearsome psychotic warlord who wears a teeth-bar mask, he is chillingly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the sadistic villain ""Toecutter"" in the 1979 cult-classic original Mad Max. Joe with his army of murderous gonzo warriors and tricked-out vehicles race across the desert, he will stop at nothing to recover his female property and is totally hellbent on stopping them. Masterful direction by Miller, exceptional supporting performances by Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Nathan Joe, Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Gunting-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abby Lee, Courtney Eaton, but it's Charlize Theron's feminist freedom fighter that surprisingly steals this awesome film. Dazzling cinematography by John Seale, with extraordinary razor-sharp editing by Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel. The film has breathtaking stunt work. A cinematic work of jaw-dropping imagination and artistic craftsmanship, a total masterpiece.

The film's striking and vivid colors evoke a visual style reminiscent of darker sci-fi realms or the aesthetics of video games.\nIn this chapter, Tom Hardy takes on the role of Max, but his portrayal may leave viewers yearning for a more conventional and relatable hero. Max's limited dialogue, replaced by animalistic utterances, contributes to a sense of disconnection between the character and the audience.\nThe action sequences in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are undeniably extravagant, with a penchant for pushing the boundaries of plausibility. The relentless pursuit and audacious stunts, while visually impressive, may border on the excessive for some viewers.\nRegrettably, the film's storyline is notably thin, serving more as a backdrop for the visual spectacle than as a fully developed narrative. The world it portrays is bleak, with survival as the central focus, and this simplicity extends to the storytelling.\n""Mad Max: Fury Road"" may dazzle with its aesthetics and action, but it falls short of achieving a balanced cinematic experience.

6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b3e1,tt1392190,Mad Max: Fury Road,granddivineentertainment,15 October 2023,10,"I watched this movie with my sister and some friends in theaters back when it came out. My Dad had showed my sister and I The Road Warrior and I had LOVED it- when the trailer for this came out she excitedly showed us and I was drawn right in. We ended up going to see it and I can say for certain I have never had a movie-going experience like this one...\nI always envied people who got to see films back when movies were still exciting novelties that could blow audiences away, like the first audiences to see Star Wars, and I was sad id never get to experience that type of thrill. Boy was I wrong.\nThis movie is better than any roller-coaster ive ever been on; better than any drug ive ever done; more adrenalyne pumping than any near death experience Ive ever had and has truly earned that funny phrase ""better than sex."" It is a non-stop, straight forward action filled ROMP where every single detail has been considered and you notice something new everytime. Every shot; every cut; every punch; every bullet fired; every crash; every scream; every explosion, gets your heart pumping faster and faster as you feel more and more invested in the conflict our heroes face. Part of that is because despite minimal dialogue and maximum action- you care more about these characters thsn you will in most modern movies. This movie has HEART, and a great message. It's story-telling and themes are the epitome of show don't tell. There is rarely exposition dialogue, instead props, scenes, and character costumes communicate everything you need to know about them and this hellworld our story takes place in. More is communicated in a simple nod than most movies achieve in entire scenes- partly credit to the actors and partly just because the writing and pacing are executed flawlessly. Sometimes I rewatch it when I want to feel inspired in our own warlord-run wasteland.\nThis movie is all gas; no breaks, start to finish. Incredibly rewatchable and never loses that high-octane adrenalyne rush I felt upon first viewing.\nWhen we finished the movie that first time we went, it was downpouring out with thunder and lightning. But we were so amped up that as I drove everyone home, my friends and sister in the backseat leaned out windows and climbed out the sunroof to scream ""WITNESS ME!"" into the raging storm... in defiance of all that things ahead on the road... 2015 was a simpler time.\nThis is my favorite film, and it's not even close.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,
6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b3e2,tt0439572,The Flash,fernandoschiavi,3 January 2024,6,"The plot begins with a powerful action scene, in which Barry Allen-Flash (Ezra Miller) is called to help the victims of a terrorist attack in a hospital. While the opening sequence already manages to give us the tone of the film, it also serves as an impetus for us to understand Barry's true intentions and the traumas he has carried for a long time - given that his mother was murdered when he was just a child and that the father took the blame and now awaits a trial that doesn't seem to have a happy ending. It is from there that, moved by the brief spark of hope in restoring a family that was torn apart by a poorly explained tragedy, Barry moves through anguish and melancholy to go back in time and prevent his mother from dying. However, what he did not expect is that his benevolent actions would trigger a series of events foreshadowing the implosion of the multiverse.\nWhat would you do if you could go back in time is the maxim that governs the feature film directed by Andy Muschietti - and a question that has certainly crossed our minds. After all, we all make mistakes and feel responsible for having acted differently and fixed what was broken. Barry, in this way, discovers that he has an ability to return to the past, breaking fragile rules of space-time to ""change events"" and ensure the survival of the one he never forgot. Now, it is remarkable how the protagonist is enveloped by a vigilante blindness that makes him forget the butterfly effect - and that takes him on a tortuous journey of reparation and nostalgia. However, no matter how noble his intentions may have been, the plan backfires and he opens a timeline parallel to the one he belongs to, creating a perpendicular rift in the multiverse that predicts catastrophe.\nFor those who watched the trailers and promotional teasers for The Flash, you will probably have few surprises throughout the 140 minutes of the feature film directed by Argentinean Andy Muschietti. From the main special appearances to the apotheotic moments, almost everything had been revealed by Warner-DC's marketing department in the advertising pieces. Which, let's face it, takes a lot of the fun and emotional impact out of scenes like Batman (Michael Keaton) saying his iconic line ""I am Batman"". Surprising moments are really rare, usually references to other incarnations of the publisher's main superheroes in cinema and television. The plot itself shows Barry surprising himself with his ability to navigate between temporal plots and landing in the past to try to change his lonely present of orphanhood (dead mother and imprisoned father). When going back in time, he comes across his 18-year-old version, still without the powers brought by an unlikely combination of chemical elements and lightning fallen from the sky. However, the protagonist did not imagine that this world would be different from his own in certain ways, with several variants and few familiar constants. Batman is a different person, Superman Kal-el has a different destiny, but Zod (Michael Shannon) continues to come to Earth to conquer it and revive his home, Krypton.\nThe Barry of the past is the hero who is reluctant when faced with the call to adventure, but who proves his worth along the journey of maturity. The Barry of the present is the mentor who guides his younger version to learn, thereby demonstrating the ability to be more than Batman's boy wonder - the same dramatic curve as Peter Parker, who proved to be more than Batman's boy wonder of Iron Man. Absolutely everything revolves around these parallel and complementary journeys of the Barrys, but that doesn't make The Flash a serious film about feelings, traumas and adult sensations. In addition to personal controversies, Ezra Miller had proven in other works to be an actor with repertoire, something that in this new super production is only partially valued. An irritating and loud teenager, the Barry of the past gains space and constantly supplants the seriousness of the Barry of the present, who carries the character's tragic tones. Andy Muschietti chooses to give more time and importance to the comic content, thereby sabotaging items such as: the hero's sadness aspects, the obsolescence of Michael Keaton's Batman and the strong personality of Supergirl (Sasha Calle). No wonder, Batman and Supergirl are demoted to mere occasional colleagues. Batman is still valued for its nostalgic aspect, but Krypton's daughter is compromised by the suffocation of drama.\nIn addition to this issue, the film is tonally very strange, with an initial sequence of frantic action in Gotham City that serves to make it very clear that the Flash in this film is the Flash from Justice League, complete with Jeremy Irons' Alfred and the Ben Affleck's Batman (albeit wearing an absolutely hideous version of his costume). At the beginning, the tone is openly comical, with Ezra Miller reveling in his dramatic limitations as a court jester, with the beating itself taking on a veneer that was supposed to be hilarious, but which ends up only generating yellow smiles due to the exaggeration of the whole thing, including a newborn rescue sequence in a hospital featuring horrific visual effects of these babies. Then, in the other universe, the footprint is opposite, darker and heavier, but also more rushed and without Muschietti, at any point, really having the courage to bet his chips on it, which leaves room for inconveniences of displaced humor that they detract from the whole and deflate the drama, especially because the development of the two Barry Allens, especially the youngest, is relegated to the background and then, almost instantly, is accelerated from 0 to 100 without giving time.\nAnother problem that weighs heavily on ""The Flash"", especially in the final third of the projection, is the visual effects. And it's not just a standard complaint about hero films: the thing is bad even by the low standards that Marvel has been presenting lately. The opening sequence, with Flash saving falling babies, is terrible on a PlayStation 2 level and there are several racing scenes that all feel artificial and weightless. And it's something that really hinders the experience, as it takes away the impact of key moments. There are special appearances that are made entirely (and without purpose in certain cases) in CGI that look like rubber and wax dolls with which it is impossible to create any connection. What should be nerd apotheosis becomes just something shameful. Luckily for fans and spectators, Muschietti manages to balance the poverty of the effects with a firm pulse on the progress of the story. In the end, it is thanks to his direction that ""The Flash"" manages to deliver something that DC has never managed before: uncompromised and unpretentious fun.\nThe rest of the film, especially its final minutes once again in the chronosphere, is a search for references and fan service that irritatingly has become the standard for blockbusters of the genre. Out the window goes the story, which is then summarily replaced by the absolute and inescapable emptiness that are the moments that exist only for the viewer to point at the screen and identify this or that character and object more quickly than their friend next door. The cinematic experience, therefore, becomes an uninspired child's game that requires nothing from anyone other than a frankly useless encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture.\nEven with all the references, ""The Flash"" rarely excites. The battle scenes have few textures and the action is generic and poorly finished accordingly. Post-production is responsible for showing super-powered beings in battles so sumptuous that they lose sight of the human dimension of these extraordinary men and women. And, by the way, the quality of the CGI is not always consistent with the economic power of the production. An initiative full of special appearances, Flash's first solo adventure serves to introduce the concept of the multiverse to DC and make beautiful tributes to his long and sometimes sleepy journey. This journey of weak emotions includes never-before-realized cinematic versions of characters such as Nicolas Cage's Superman (one of the good ideas) and tributes to the precursors of the wave that has reigned for more than 20 years in cinema with a more industrial feel. Furthermore, there are good jokes about changes in timelines - the best of which is about the protagonism of the ""Back to the Future"" Saga. In fact, recharging the ""flux capacitor"" with lightning is another affective borrowing from Robert Zemeckis' creation. However, the solutions are lazy and difficult problems are solved with simplistic strategies - like the lightning bolt that, if replicated, could create armies of Flashes? In the end, even the resolution of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is recycled by DC Comics. Reality almost collapses for the protagonist to learn to accept losses and understand the value of his scars. This film, at least, should be the last of DC's current phase, serving as a reboot of the universe - so it's strange to see a Batman from the past hated by fans appearing in the final scenes in a questionable and confusing participation - it's strange to think that ""Blue Beetle"" and ""Aquaman 2"" would still be released after this production.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,
6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b3e3,tt0439572,The Flash,henry8-3,3 January 2024,6,"Barry / The Flash's life is subsumed with the fact that his father is in jail for the murder of his mother. When he discovers that he can run faster than the speed of light, he decides, against the advice of Bruce Wayne, to go back in time to put things right. As we all know though, such plans are always fraught with danger, time line wise and this is no different.\nWhilst Barry and his past self played by Ezra Miller are largely good fun in this, there are significant sections where they are both deeply irritating which is somewhat distracting. In addition the film includes a contribution by Supergirl played by Sasha Calle giving, at odds with the rest of the film's tone, one of the most miserable performances seen since The Grapes of Wrath hit the screen.\nThat said this is one of the more enjoyable DC superhero movies of the last few years featuring an entertaining story, fun set pieces and strong FX throughout. The big draw here though is the introduction of shots and cameos of past beloved superheroes (and some who nearly were) and a starring role for Michael Keaton returning as Batman. The man provides much kudos here as does the accompanying suit, quite beautifully realised bat cave, bat mobile and plane, even Danny Elfman's glorious music.

The film is full of action, humor, and heart, and it features a great cast of characters, including Ezra Miller as Barry Allen, Michael Keaton as Batman, and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. The film's action sequences are particularly dazzling, and they showcase Barry's lightning-fast abilities in breathtaking slow-motion sequences. But beneath the thrills, The Flash beats with a surprisingly emotional core. Barry's quest to save his mother fuels the narrative, exploring themes of family, loss, and the power of connection across time. Ultimately, The Flash is a triumph of heart, spectacle, and pure superhero joy. It's a film that celebrates family, embraces second chances, and reminds us that even the fastest man alive needs a little human connection. So buckle up, grab your popcorn, and prepare to be swept away by this electrifying cinematic adventure.

6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b3ea,tt0439572,The Flash,khanbaliq2,28 December 2023,8,"This year saw the release of two enjoyable films by DC Studios - Shazam! Fury Of The Gods and The Flash. If Walter Hamada is the man that's responsible for the DC Studios films that got released in the last few years, he deserves praise, in my opinion, because I enjoyed seeing almost every DCEU film that got released from 2019 to 2023. The Flash, in particular, is my favorite film of this year so far. Sure, it's not as good as, let us say, Across The Spider-Verse, but it affected me the most. The Flash is admittedly silly at times, but almost everything else in this film works well. It's clear that plenty of effort and money went into making The Flash. After The Suicide Squad (2021), The Flash is my favorite film in the DCEU. First of all, the cast, especially Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton, delivered good performances. The Flash does seem like a star vehicle for Miller. There are a few scenes in the film that are actually moving. This is something that can be said about only several superhero movies that got made in the last decade because most of them attempted to deliver only laughs and entertainment. But The Flash still features some effective comedy. One of the reasons why The Flash is often effective is because it features a good music score by Benjamin Wallfisch. What's also worth mentioning is that The Flash is kind of like a comeback for the American flag. The American flag is in the film for a bit and it looks glorious when it appears. The American flag hasn't looked this good in a film for about a decade or more. Sure, the American flag isn't a very good actor. The performances of the American flag are mostly stiff and of one note. But the American flag doesn't get cast in films because of its acting chops. It gets cast because of its good looks. There were rumors that the American flag had turned to drugs, and perhaps this is the reason why it looked bad in the films in which it appeared in the last decade. But I'm here to tell everyone that the American flag is back! Not since the 1990s has the American flag looked this good on screen. Perhaps the American flag has been spending time at the gym and consuming dietary supplements.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b4e,,,,,

Apparently Jaiyah wasn't in the team in this point of history in real life, but they are a real person and I thought it was great that their story was incorporated into the movie.

Oscar Kightley is the MVP though, that endless optimism wins you over instantly and the film wisely knows to keep him around for as much as possible.\nTaika Waititi's direction is so recognisably him, mostly for the better.

Here it's the adequate Michael Fassbender who gets to portray the down on his luck coach (Thomas Rongen) in this factually based story. He's not much good at his job and is temperamentally a bit unreliable, so is dispatched to coach what is officially the world's worst team. American Samoa, still smarting from a 31-0 thumping at the hands of the ever so slightly more populated Australia, has a team whose viability is under scrutiny by the parent American Federation. Can Rongen turn things around? His team are the traditionally disparate group of well-meaning, distinctly amateur, enthusiasts. Unused to any concept of team playing, co-ordination and/or training - and their new boss's predilection for a bottle or two doesn't suggest change is going to come anytime soon. Local federation boss Tavita (Oscar Kightley) manages to inspire though - and what happens now is all rather predictable, but engagingly portrayed, as the team start to realise that defeat each time is not as inevitable as they might expect. It does present us with quite an interesting look at Polynesian attitudes - ones of compassion, fairness and tolerance. Winning is important, but it's not the be all and end all; and the eventual make up of their team - and it's constituent parts - is testament to a society that has way more right than it has wrong in the way it thinks and behaves. There's loads of humour - most of which comes from an on-form Kightley, but I found that a bit weak and just a little too stereotypical (albeit from their perspective rather than the American's). The best bits are probably in the trailers, but it's still just about worth a watch - but the television will be fine.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

What makes this film interesting is how it chronicles the creation of a series of sports shoes and the Nike corporation's attempt to make a deal with Michael Jordan. It seems like a small thing, but it was an event that would leave precedents in the history of sports, taking the Nike corporation to the top, changing the corporate paradigm of the sports footwear industry and bringing Michael Jordan himself to stardom. The film does not show the events as such, it simply uses dialogues between the businessmen to narrate the process. Matt Damon presents a quite astute and determined character who knows how to use his wit very well. Although Chris Tucker doesn't appear much, he doesn't lose that comedic energy that made him memorable in the Rush Hour trilogy. Michael Jordan's appearance in the film is quite mysterious because it does not show his face and that may be a bit disappointing for those who knew him, either because of his basketball games or because of his participation in Space Jam. Anyway, it is understandable because of the time in which the film was made and the time in which the events take place. In addition, the film has a good soundtrack of eighties songs, giving this film an eighties feel that feels almost nostalgic. Even the introduction that begins the credits is a nice collage of television broadcasts from that time. Air is a good dramatic film with a good plot that Ben Affleck knew how to execute, showing that he is capable of directing good films and not just acting in them.

The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""\nIn other words, ""Don't believe everything you think.""\nI just find it amusing how many people make assumptions, and are so certain of themselves, yet their criticism has no basis in reality\n""First, the storyline is very good though I don't trust its honesty based on Hollywood's track record of distorting so-called true stories.""\n""but much of it doesn't appear to be factual ""\nHere is some advice for all the wannabe film critics out there: When a film is billed ""based on true events,"" that means...take it with a grain of salt. Filmmakers use a lot of artistic license; they are accorded leeway in his or her interpretation of something and is not held strictly accountable for accuracy. It's not a documentary.\nShow me ONE, just ONE movie ""based on true events"" that is 100% accurate. They do not exist.\nThis is for all the cry babies who object to the fact that Jordan did not appear in the film...which, by the way, the cry babies could have looked up, but no, they wanted to complain.\n""MJ is a legend, he's such a god you can't show his likeness, you might be Charlie Hebdo'd.""\nIn the midst of promoting the film, Ben Affleck has given an interview to the Hollywood Reporter, where he explained the conscious and excellent decision for the star not to appear in the film.\n""When you become much more than a hero, an athlete or even an icon, you start to be an idea to people. You touch them and you start to represent hope, excellence and greatness. You are unique,"" he began.\n""There was no way I was going to ask the public to believe that someone other than Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan. It was a deliberate choice. I thought he was too majestic for anyone to imitate. Jordan is too big,"" he continued.\nOne guy said: ""However, the film neglects to tell us that Vaccaro soon left Nike to work for Adidas.""\nActually he was fired by Nike in 1991 - six years after the release of Air Jordans - but moved on to work for Adidas and then for Reebok. He and Strasser and Moore all went to Adidas, where they forged that company's floundering basketball program into Nike's biggest competitor.\nThis is for all the cry babies who complained about the Jordans' ""greed.""\nNo, the Jordan family was not greedy. That scene was pure fiction. In reality, Deloris never insisted on Jordan getting a cut of the profits from his shoe, but she was instrumental in pushing Michael to pick Nike's offer over other, more prestigious sneaker deals.\nMrs. Jordan heads several charities. In 1989, Mrs. Jordan and her son co-founded the Michael Jordan Foundation to raise money for disadvantaged children. Not only was she the President of the foundation, but she also began the Michael Jordan Education Club that encouraged students to improve their grades and attendance. Soooo greedy, huh?\nMichael Jordan did not receive the red Mercedes 380SL he insisted on from all three interested parties. Instead, Vaccaro pulled out two toy cars and started rolling them on the conference table.\n""Yet big corporations can make 'movies' like this to inject their brand into the brains of people.""\n""Objectionable propoganda (sic) for Nike and Jordan, and Ben Affleck should be ashamed of himself.""\n""This film was made by Nike, for Nike and to increase Nike's sales. ""\nNope. Ben Affleck did not seek Nike's approval for 'Air' - only Michael Jordan's. ""It's not a history of Nike,"" Affleck said of his new film.

In the movie, based on a true story, Ford Automobile aims to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, known as the longest race in history. For this, they begin to design a vehicle together with car designers Carroll Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale).\nEven though it was about the 1966 Le Mans races, the image quality and graphics were at a high level. Night shots were especially exciting. The film's cinematographer, Phedon Papamichael, seems to have done a good job. Also, the vehicles in the movie are completely real. So they didn't come up with a computer design. This is another enjoyable part of the job.\nThe acting was sufficient for this movie, which was static except for the racing parts. In fact, it was too much for a drama movie. Jon Bernthal, whom we also know from The Walking Dead series, was at least as good as the leading roles. It was the first time in over 50 years that a motor sports film (previously Grand Prix, 1966) won an Oscar. Oscar awards were given to the best sound editing and best editing. The first names considered for the leading roles in Kings of Asphalt were Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Maybe they could have won the best actor Oscar with these names. However, it is not known whether the movie would seem this sincere. Because Bale now sets the bar so high that you break away from the movie and just watch Bale.\nIn recent years, more sports movies have started to be made. The 2013 movie Zafere Rush is one of them. They are similar in fiction to the Kings of Asphalt. Although Rush had a weaker cast, I liked this movie more because it was about the more popular Formula Grand Prix. However, none of these prevent the Kings of Asphalt from making history.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

When it first came out, I thought maybe I'd like to see it, but I can't STAND modern special effects, and modern films as a whole. So when I noticed it was going to be on TV recently, I DVR'd it. I could type quite a lot, but will try to keep this as short as possible.\nFirstly, I have owned 4 Ford vehicles so far, and they are my favorite current American brand. BUT, my favorite racing cars are vintage Ferraris. So I was conflicted before I even hit PLAY.\nI'll get my brutally honest negative opinions done first. The film is WAY too long. Most of the family scenes should have been edited out, as they only slow the plot down. Just because modern audiences expect women to be in a movie, doesn't mean they should be in every one. This is the story of Ford, Ferrari, racing, and the 1960s. Sorry, but women didn't play a pivotal role in the actual events.\nIt felt like I was watching a video game instead of race scenes. Granted, the effects are of high quality BUT they just feel fake. Go watch ""Le Mans"" or ""Grand Prix"", and you will FEEL the difference between CGI and the real thing.\nWhy didn't they even show the other two GT40s (black & gold) during the Le Mans race? I already knew about the 1-2-3 photo finish, and it seems to me the other cars should have at least been shown during the race. Otherwise those cars and drivers aren't of any importance at all.\nHalf of the actors were mis-cast, either not looking anything like the real men (a buff Iacocca??), or just plain over-actors.\nThe soundtrack could have been SO much better, too.\nStuff I DID like were details like the little lights which illuminated the cars' racing numbers at night. Engine sounds seemed accurate. I like how they showed the progression of the prototype cars, from the first GT to the MkII and onward. It was good to see Shelby driving an AC based Cobra, not a big fat-fender kit car like I'd expect Hollywood to give him. I did see what looked like a bad replica Ferrari 250GT California in one shot.\nMatt Damon is SO not Carroll Shelby, but his acting was good nonetheless. The actor who played the lead mechanic sounded just like Dennis Weaver!\nSo basically everything put in the film for car buffs, I generally liked, though CGI will never win me over. Everything in there for female viewers (of which I am one) I thought was a total waste of film. A better soundtrack, some better veteran actors, and some more inspired direction would have made me happier with the film.\nBUT who am I, after all?",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

You've got to earn your freedom and a little competition never hurts. In a way, the rubber ball works as the film's existential allegory : sometimes you just can't dodge all the hits, you've got to take them and learn to hit back.\nThe first ten minutes of the film set the tone through a hilarious commercial. You've got a cocky and arrogant successful gym franchise owner, a body and self-confidence building guru named White Goodman, played by a Ben Stiller at the top of his game. From his hair-mullet to his horseshoe moustache and his ""we're better than you"" slogan, you know this is someone who's trying to compensate past demons. In fact, he doesn't deny it himself: six years before, he was a morbidly obese loser. Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is more laid-back and amiable, so careless that he must raise 50.000 dollars to pay his mortgage and prevent what's left from his gym to be bought out by his rival. It's not even the loss that concerns him but that his buddies would lose their little haver.\nAnd what a colorful gallery of lovable schmucks! Justin Long is an awkwardly shy and clumsy high school student who joined a cheerleading team to impress his love interest, Stephen Root is an equivalent of his iconic ""Office Space"" Milton. Alan Tudyk is Steve ""Pirate"" Cowan who takes his ""being a pirate"" so seriously that it quickly ceases to be a matter of puzzlement but rather an inspirational self-acceptance model. As two of Peter's employees, there's also Joel David Moore and Chris Williams and finally, we have Christine Taylor -Stiller's wife- as Kate Veatch, an assigned tax lawyer who, despite her tremendous skills, can't join the team (the bank is sponsored by Globo Gym so it would be a conflict of interest) but something about Goodman's seduction skills inevitably led her to becoming a pivotal member of the Average Joe's team.\nIt's one thing to pretend to read a dictionary, inflate the 'crotch' zone and pull a 'Basic Instinct' but another to fire a woman to better date her or deliver some embarrassingly bordernline-harrassment lines. In fact the only redeeming quality of Goodman is that he's so hilariously obnoxious that we enjoy laughing at his incapability to read the signs. I mean, once you've made a woman throw up in her mouth, what's left? With such a great villain, Vaughn doesn't have to force himself to be likable, not that he doesn't play it smooth either with Kate. She ultimately joins the team and after winning a regional match against Girl Scouts (the twist is hilarious), they enter the official tournament in Vegas, and gags ensues as rapidly as balls get thrown at players.\nAnd so we get the obligatory unorthodox training sessions from Patches O'Houllian, a former champion played by Rip Torn, some hilarious moments that would make any 80s baby recall the ""Simpsons"", from the classic ""you made me bleed my own blood"" to the hilarious spoof of 50s politically incorrect 50s educationals clips with a fun performance from Hank Azaria as a young Patches. Add to that an unrecognizable Missi Pyle as a foreign athlete with an impossible name, hilarious cameos from David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris or William Shatner and last but not least, some awkward interactions between other ""Office Space"" star Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the show's commentators, ""Dodgeball"" never leaves thirty seconds going without a gag or a funny line.\nBut it all comes down to the rivalry between Vaughn and Stiller, the insecure Napoleon surrounded by thugs with the name of Blade, Laser, Blazer or Me'Chell, and the dude who's so humble and modest you don't even notice that he towers over everyone. Vaughn doesn't play Peter as a good but rather a straight man, and with all the zaniness surrounding him, he's as well-cast as the stoic and no-nonsense Bob Hoskins in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Some of his verbal interactions with Stiller are just funny because he doesn't even try to outsmart his opponent while the other tries so hard he fails lamentably.\n""Dodgeball"" took me back to a bygone time where humor could allow itself to be as raunchy, vulgar and outrageous as it gets without ever making it a vital concern to be offensive to a community: the early 2000s. Movies that allowed two straight guys to make gay jokes in ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" or a blackface to be a plot element in ""Tropic Thunder"". It's fair to say that such movies would be impossible to make for there are guidelines now that infected the creative process up to the casting. Some Youtubers even conceded, while reacting to their first viewing that it was the early 2000s and I was saddened not to detect a hint of nostalgia.\nMaybe it's a generational thing but as a proud early Millennial, I could savor the humor of ""Dodgeball"" like a good old South Park episode for it's not just funny, it's also very smart. You earn your happy ending with laughs, heart-warming moments and clever twists. Let's hope the sequel lives up to its predecessor...",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

I love that Christine Taylor hates her real-life husband in this. It feels a bit rushed getting to the final showdown between Average Joe's and Globo-Gym, but that last match has some pretty tense action.

Dodgeball gifts the world with hilarious lines to be quoted repeatedly, Chuck Norris gifs, and laughs that keep going long after the movie ends.

6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b41f,tt0317219,Cars,CinemaSerf,6 December 2023,7,"So the shiny, red, ""Lightning McQueen"" is determined to make it to distant California to compete in the ""Piston Cup"". Along the way he stops off in the small town of ""Radiator Springs"" where he manages to tear up their road. His punishment? Well they have a giant tarmac laying machine, so he has to get it to resurface the road before he can be on his merry way. This isn't an easy task, and in order to finish that job he's going to have to find some allies. That's not so easy for this cocky and tunnel-visioned character, but as he gradually starts to listen, learns and make friends, he realises that there is much more to life than this one race! There's a gently bubbling moral to the story - learning to value the more important things in life like friendship, teamwork and self-reliance, and the characterisations of ""Sally"" - a lithe and stylish Porsche and ""Mater"" - a tow truck that looks like it's held together by Wrigley's and good will, help drum this message into ""Lightning' and the watching audience. There's plenty of colourful and vibrant action alongside quite a bit of humour (and puns!) from the writing to keep it going and although I found this a bit wordy - and perhaps just a little too focussed for internal (US) consumption, it's still an enjoyable start to what I assume will become quite a flexible franchise.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

Disney Pixar Cars is my all time favorite Disney Movie, yes it's not the best but it's still a great film and a fun one at best. It has a great story with Lighting McQueen who is a hot shot rookie racer who comes across an abandoned town and has to get used to the scenery around it which makes him miss his race, but in the end he learns a lot and it makes him realize that there is more to racing than just winning. The animation is beautiful and the characters are extremely likable and relatable. But the reason why I love this movie so much is because it made me who I am, and that's a race car driver. When I was young, this movie was a huge part of my childhood, watching it a lot with my family, playing with the toys, video games, and going to Disneyland to ride the Cars ride. This movie means so much to me as it taught me many things about not just racing, but good human qualities like being a good friend, learning from the best and accepting change. This movie also got me into my biggest hobby and that's racing. I became a huge NASCAR fan after the movie when I learned more about it and I instantly became hooked. But the biggest this movie has done is that it made me an actual race car driver. Racing has been a huge part of my life and it's been a dream of mine to become a race driver, and this movie did just that. It inspired me to become a driver, learn more about cars and try to follow your dreams of becoming a champion. Overall, I'm so grateful that this movie has done for me in the long run, as it made me who I am today. Cars is indeed a great film to watch especially for kids and families alike and this movie crosses the finish line and is a winner to everyone who watches it! And always remember, there is more to racing than just winning, and without your friends, your trophy is just an empty cup. Ka Chow!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

This plot point in a way mirrors the world we live in today. It reminded me about blockbusters, which was a tangible place to search for films and socialise, and how it was gradually taken over by streaming services and eventually shut down. The same thing is happening with shops and restaurants, where most people want to have things ordered online and to their doorstep instead of going to the place itself. While these modern alternatives might be easier and more ideal, are we losing what made these activities so enjoyable in the first place?\n""Cars didn't drive on it to make good time, they drove on it to have a great time""\nI feel like cars has surprisingly aged very well, and each time I watch it, I find the route 66 aspect of the film more relatable and very relevant, even if that wasn't the pure intention of the film.

This movie exceeded my expectations in every way possible and left me feeling so incredibly entertained and satisfied. Pixar has once again proven that they are masters of storytelling and animation.\nWhen I first heard about Cars, I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical. How could a movie featuring only vehicles, with no human characters, keep me engaged for a full two hours? But Pixar managed to do just that, and more.\nDirector John Lasseter's attention to detail is truly remarkable. Every car and truck in the movie becomes a unique character with its own personality. The way they bend and gesture in ways that are true to their construction is just incredible. It's these small details that make the world of Cars so immersive and believable.\nAnd speaking of the world, the story itself is filled with charm and heart. Yes, it may contain a well-traveled theme, but it's delivered in such a way that it feels fresh and meaningful. I found myself genuinely caring about Lightning McQueen's journey and rooting for him every step of the way.\nNow, I'm not a racing fan by any means, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. You don't need to be a racing enthusiast to appreciate the story and the characters. The film goes beyond the world of racing and delves into themes of self-discovery, friendship, and the importance of slowing down and enjoying life. It's a message that resonated with me, and I'm sure it will resonate with many others as well.\nVisually, Cars is a feast for the eyes. The animation is stunning, and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. The scenery is so beautifully rendered that it's hard to believe it's not real. From the reflections on the cars to the weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk, every little detail has been meticulously crafted. It's a visual spectacle that left me in awe.\nBut impressive visuals alone are not enough to make a great movie. Thankfully, Cars delivers on all fronts. The characters are well-developed, and the story is engaging. Pixar took the time to give us a movie that is not just visually stunning, but also emotionally resonant. They didn't succumb to the pressure of making a shorter film to cater to shorter attention spans. Instead, they stayed true to their vision and created a movie that is both entertaining and meaningful.\nCars started off with a disadvantage in my eyes, but it quickly won me over. It made me care about its characters and their journey. It made me reflect on my own life and the importance of slowing down and enjoying the journey. It made me want to take a road trip and explore the unknown. It made me appreciate the scenic route.\nIn the end, Cars is a testament to Pixar's ability to create movies that go beyond entertainment. It's a movie that makes you care about something other than yourself, even if just for a little while. It's a movie that reminds us of the power of storytelling and the magic of animation.\nPixar has once again made it look simple, but we all know that creating a movie as wonderful as Cars takes a tremendous amount of talent and hard work. I can confidently give Cars a rating of 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story and breathtaking animation.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b427,tt0317219,Cars,Mcduff3601,30 August 2023,8,I have watched this movie countless times since it's release and I am still not sick of it yet. When my daughter was born we introduced her to it and she requested AGAIN AGAIN.\nEven after all those agains I could again and again still which says a lot about the quality of the movie. All the characters are great and work really well together. Owen Wilson as the stuck up McQueen is perfect for this role.\nThe story is pretty good and it's funny to see the cars world vs the human world. There are some questions that have occurred to me over the watchings like where do baby cars come from. But I will ask an adult about that later.\nFor now I will just recommend this again and again.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b428,tt0082158,Chariots of Fire,kokkinoskitrinosmple,30 December 2023,5,"The movie is based on the duality of its two main characters, who are both giving it their all to win the Olympic gold medal. Harold Abrahams faces an internal conflict, he runs to overcome his identity, he wants to be known as a runner rather than as a Jew. Eric Liddell, on the other hand, knows and accepts exactly who he is and where he stands, he runs to further embrace his faith and honour his Creator.\nDespite the major differences in their background, their mentality and their state of mind, it's clear that they are both decent, virtuous men, products of a bygone era and that could explain why I found it hard to relate with them and lost interest fairly quickly. Even though I wasn't familiar with the real life events, the predictable outcome didn't help in that regard either.\nThe highlight of the film is Vangelis' wonderful music and the main reason the opening scene remains ever so iconic, his Oscar was well-deserved.\nThe running scenes are well crafted, though I couldn't help but laugh with Eric's running style.\nBritain looks as green and as beautiful as ever. The movie succeeds in depicting nicely both the time (early '20s) and the place (the atmosphere of Cambridge in particular).",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

You're genuinely interested in the two different athletes and how they relate to each other, why they run. The soundtrack is pretty memorable too. I really did enjoy this movie a lot. It sort of grows on you and by the time we get to the Olympics it really has picked up. The costumes, production design help take you back to the 1920s. There were a few small details and inventions which I had a gripe with but some artistic license I guess is what you expect in a historical film. I'd recommend this film to people of all ages, regardless of their interest in sport or not.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e3a783f0cdafc9b42a,tt0082158,Chariots of Fire,davidmvining,12 November 2023,7,"These British films that end up winning Best Picture always end up feeling so out of place. If I were transported back to before the ceremony, my guess on winner would probably have been Atlantic City or On Golden Pond, just based on the Academy's recent proclivity to awarding films with big movie stars in films that focused mostly on performances by those stars. A film about characters overcoming obstacles to win a sports event, especially one with such a focus on one of its main character's devotion to his Christianity, feels as out of place as A Man for all Seasons was.\nThe film is really about Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), whose funeral bookends the film, and Eric Liddel (Ian Charleson), but we get a curious focus on both Aubrey Montague (Nicholas Farrell) and Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers) at the same time. Lord Lindsay does something important later for Liddel, but there's a fair amount of screentime dedicated to both of the latter two characters despite none of the actual dramatics being about them. Anyway, all four are amateur runners of the British Empire. All but Liddel are students at Cambridge, while Liddel is a noted rugby player who takes up running as his passion in preparation for the 1924 Olympics.\nThe central character beats are that Abrahams is a Jew in a time and place where antisemitism was still accepted in the upper crust of society and that Liddel is a devoted Christian (raised on a Chinese mission and dedicated to returning to it) who has to choose between his dedication to his God and his dedication to his athletic pursuits. I do think the film is a good one, but I see both of these, as presented in the film, as making mountains out of molehills. Abrahams is enrolled in Cambridge and not barred from anything he wants to do, just subjected to the occasional snide comment about his Jewishness while never denied anything. Liddel faces no conflict between his faith and his athletic competitions until late in the film, and it's introduced and solved within minutes. I know that the producer, David Puttnam, was looking for a story about men who would not yield to outside pressure to violate their beliefs (in the vein of A Man for All Seasons), but this is small beans.\nAnyway, the story is about the handful of men pushing themselves to their limits in order to win their athletic competitions. Liddel has a great moment where he's pushed to the ground near the start of the race, gets up, and then pushes himself to his absolute limits to win. Harold watches this race and feels the need to enlist the aid of Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a running coach, a decision that makes the deans of Cambridge none too happy in a scene that could have been hard cut out of the film and no one would have noticed. It does have an ironic coda later, but it should be noted that their protestations have nothing to do with Harold's Jewishness and everything to do with his hiring a professional coach, and not even Harold brings up the idea that the excuse is a screen for some sort of motive against his ethnicity and religion. Instead, he goes off and starts seeing the singer Sybil (Alice Krige), who adores him.\nOf course, the film is a multi-year journey as they prepare for the Olympics, and the Olympics dominate the final third of the film as they go to Paris, meet the Prince of Wales, the eventual Edward VIII, (David Yelland), and Liddel has his moment of strength when the 100-meter heat is scheduled for a Sunday, and he refuses to race on a Sunday. The scene around the British legation, including the Prince of Wales, trying to pressure Liddel into racing on Sunday despite his beliefs, is a good one for sure, but the obstacle is introduced and dispatched (by Lord Lindsay) so quickly that it almost feels like an afterthought rather than a central dramatic tenet of the film.\nThe dramatics are where the movie doesn't succeed very well, but as a portrait of two men pushing themselves to the physical extreme, it's kind of great. The exhaustion of the effort, the passion put into it, the sacrifices made are all wonderfully demonstrated and dramatized on screen. Liddel's real central drama isn't around running on Sunday but in conflict with his sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) who thinks that Eric is dedicated too much time to his training instead of his work as a mission in Scotland (before he goes back to China, of course), as well as Harold in conflict with Sybil and Sam, his efforts never quite being good enough for the latter but taking him away from the former.\nIt's also an interesting portrait of a time when post-modernism was taking hold in culture but the cultural institutions hadn't embraced it yet. The sense of traditionalism was still strong, as evidenced by people like the Master of Trinity College (John Gielgud), but the dedication to the concept of nationhood was already fraying, as evidenced by the early interaction with WWI veterans, scarred by the war.\nIt's a handsome film that can't quite bring its central dramatics to the heights of something like, yes, A Man for All Seasons, a story about a man who put his life on the line for his beliefs and paid for it compared to a film about a young man who put his athletic career on the line for his beliefs, and then found a way around it. It works more as a portrait than as a dramatic retelling of the events around the British running team at the 1924 Olympics, but that portrait is really quite good.\nStill, its win at the Oscars feels so out of place.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

The decision will not only be based on athletic abilities but social standing and religion. Everyone has his or her agenda from the promoters to the runners themselves. In the end, compromises must be made but for the final chosen there can be no compromise to win.\nThis is a movie that holds your attention on several levels. Many of the actors are easily recognizable but they do not overshadow the characters they represent. The scenery is switched from Scotland countryside to Cambridge, and France (actually shot in England). Of course, as depicted in the cover picture the most notable is the run along the beach (West Sands Beach, St Andrews, Scotland, UK.) Then the music, most noticeable in the beach scenes but permeated the movie will stay with you for years (Original music by Vangelis.)

The wonderful and unique soundtrack by Vangelis for example. And then there is also good acting and great cinematography. There's always something nice for the eyes to see or the ears to hear. However the characters seem to be missing something and feel bland. The story sounds good and inspiring in theory and it isn't bad, it's just that it was simply too stretched out and predictable. I found myself watching the remaining time a lot and asking myself just when the story will make some interesting points or manages to make me invested... sadly it didn't. With all the good reviews and awards this movie received, I just hoped for some more. I'll still say go watch it, as maybe I'm an exception here.

They come at it from an example of pro-Christianity to the foibles of a world where we are controlled by such things. I also read that there are numerous inaccuracies in this film, concerning the two principle players. A little bit of Hollywood. But the problem is that the Hollywood diminishes the effect of the film, in my opinion. If the guy knew well ahead that his race was going to be on a Sunday, then the business of a last minute decision is bogus. Also, there is a degree of generosity given to the Olympic committee that simply would not have taken place. It is about courage to an extent, but I hesitate to give it too much credit. If you buy into a religion then buy into it. Don't make these guys martyrs because they can't run a race. No one will die. No one's life will be destroyed. They continue to have the adulation of their fans. I think the only part that bothered me was the snooty Oxford guys and their anti-semitism, enjoying the challenges of the Jewish guy.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

It tells the story of two British athletes who strove to thrive at the Olympiad in Paris in 1924. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) comes from a Lithuanian Jewish background. Who is welcomed to Cambridge University, but never quite accepted. The other is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian who comes from missionary stock and who believes that he must serve God before himself - and that includes not running any races on the Sabbath. Both of these men have considerable athletic skills, and the story intertwines their efforts to get to the Games, whilst both must deal with their differing priorities and challenges. It's this middle portion of the film, the prologued character development phase, that all plods along too slowly. It has too little pace and too many characters, and that just drags the film down. The last fifteen minutes liven up considerably though, not just with the events on the track - but amongst those determined to ensure that the whole team attains success making sacrifices and compromises along the way. It has a classy look to it, the costumes and settings are top drawer, but I found the leading performances rather disjointed and at over two hours long, I did struggle to stay engaged.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

I liked to follow the love story of Abraham and his girlfriend at the same time, as the main plot. But for me, the sequence of the film at the beginning was too long. However, the soundtrack was catchy and was in tune with the race scenes. In the race scenes, the actors played too much on facial expressions. In short, I think that those scenes were overacted. Moreover, I found that the final 400-meter sprint went too fast. It was for me the most awaited event and I think that it was not emphasized enough.

Still wanting to be able to demonstrate her skills to college recruiters, Viola then goes to the boys' soccer coach, but he not only dismisses her request, but also humiliates her in the process as well. Even worse, her boyfriend ""Justin"" (Robert Hoffman) also joins in the laughter. Infuriated by this, Viola immediately breaks up with him. Not long afterward, she learns that her twin brother ""Sebastian"" (James Kirk) is secretly heading out of town for two weeks and--since he is living with their dad and is set to attend a different school not far away--she decides to masquerade as a guy and try out for the boys' soccer team there instead. Obviously, this subterfuge presents enough challenges on its own, but what she doesn't count on is the fact that Sebastian's girlfriend ""Monique"" (Alexandra Breckenridge) is looking for Sebastian and has a habit of appearing out of nowhere at the worst possible times. Neither does Viola factor into the equation the possibility that she might fall in love with one of the soccer players named ""Duke"" (Channing Tatum). Or for that matter, that Duke might have a crush on the prettiest girl in school named ""Olivia Lennox"" (Laura Ramsey)--who quickly becomes attracted to Viola's version of Sebastian. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I was expecting this film to be nothing more than a remake of the movie ""Just One of the Guys"" which came out 19 years earlier. And as such, I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as entertaining. To my delight, I turned out to be quite wrong, as I found this movie to be just as good with Amanda Bynes putting in a really good performance all along the way.

I can't recall how many times this masterpiece blew my mind but I recall very well the first time I had seen it, a decade after its release, on TV... And before yesterday, 9 years ago, I had seen it on DVD with who was my beloved at the time, for whom it was a first.\nWhy are these even worthy of mention, you might ask. I do think it is important for us to be able to enjoy a film at very different stages of our lives. When you're a kid, you'll look up to Rocky as the young man you wanna be. When you're of middle age, you'll understand better how Burt Young's character felt. And probably when we are much older, we may identify with Mikey who was lamenting about being 76, still chasing a chance, a dream.\nJohn G. Avildsen is the guy who set the standards for popularizing the most precious emotions. You just cannot neglect Karate Kid or Rocky. These are more than films. They are citadels of audiovisual culture.\nWatch Rocky, and then just look at a pic from some recent Sylvester Stallone movie. The difference of quality and grace is abyssmal. It just blows your mind to see that, the man who rose to fame with such a gem is today appearing in ""products"" that are literally nothing compared to Rocky.\nI won't say I don't understand it. Nor do I condemn Sly's current path. Maybe it's inevitable. Maybe it's normal that, after Rocky, you can never reach so high.\nThere's so much to say about this movie. Yet, we don't even need to put our feelings into words. The score does it for us. The climax we reach by the ending, the victory of the guy who on paper actually lost the confrontation, the love and affection he has for the woman he has gained the heart of along the way...\nRocky is not just a movie. It's that sports game you can watch again and again, knowing the result, just out of your desire to relive the emotions leading to it.\nThere are several movies we can choose as ""the best ever"". And each have their power points. But to each, you can approach also in a pedantic manner and argue this or tat could have been handled better. Borrowing an analogy of Alan Watts, only to apply it to this masterpiece:\n""Have you ever seen a misshaped wave? Or a wrong cloud? There are no such things. They come with nature exactly as they are supposed to.""\nTo me, Rocky is to cinema what a wave or a cloud is to nature. It's perfect. Just perfect, and impossible to imagine in a different way of existing.\nWhat we feel for the protagonist of the film is the exact same as what we feel for the brains and souls behind it.

Well, a sort of male Cinderella, a dream that comes true and that will change the life of both the character and the interpreter Sly forever. There's also boxing but that's marginal...

6595b4e4a783f0cdafc9b43f,tt0075148,Rocky,davidmvining,3 November 2023,10,"Sylvester Stallone wanted to make it in Hollywood, but he couldn't get cast in anything other than...stuff he'd rather forget he was ever near. So, he wrote his own screenplay, heavily influenced by Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront, and got it funded by the independent producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, and they hired the largely unremarkable young filmmaker John Avildsen to direct. The result is a tender character piece that, especially when combined with its rousing score by Bill Conti, ends up a fun, touching sports film that never loses sight of what it's about: its central character.\nRocky Balboa (Stallone) is semi-pro boxer with little technique but a lot of heart who wins more than he loses, but he can't get any particularly good fights since no one will manage him or really believes in him. He's alone in the world, trying to get the mousy, shy girl who works in the pet shop, Adrian (Talia Shire) to laugh at his corny jokes while working as a leg breaker for the small time loan shark Tony (Joe Spinelli). He has no real friends, the closest being Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young) who spends most of his time trying to convince Rocky to get him a job with Tony to get him out of his meat packing job.\nEssentially, the first hour of the film is a portrait of Rocky, his lonely life, and his early courtship with Adrian. It's a warm portrait of a bum, a guy who has something within him to make something of himself, but who has never applied himself quite right, as Mickey (Burgess Meredith) ends up saying, that he has wasted his potential on a little life in service of someone like Tony. He's also kind of dumb with the kinds of street smarts that at least allow him to acknowledge that he's made bad decisions in the past about who he had spent time with, as he outlines in a little rambling speech to a girl hanging out with the wrong crowd.\nHe gets his chance, though, when the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has spent too much time and too much money prepping for a bicentennial fight that is at the risk of cancellation because his opponent has a broken hand. With only five weeks to train, he can't get anyone ranked to commit to the fight, so he and the promoter George Jergen (Thayer David) decide on finding a local boy in Philadelphia to fight, zeroing in on Balboa for little reason more than his nickname, the Italian Stallion. He's reticent about the prospect. Rocky understands his limits and Creed's status as the best in the world, but it becomes too good of an opportunity to pass up.\nI think one of the keys to how this film works is the timing of certain events. The first is that Adrian and Rocky have their moment coming together, learning to open up to each other and fall in love, before Rocky gets his shot. This cements her as the one person he knows he can trust, as contrasted with Paulie who only seems to get helpful afterwards, hoping for a slice of the guaranteed $150,000 payout from the fight, or Mickey, who had told him off before the offer and comes begging to be his manager afterwards. After years of being rejected and used and insulted, Rocky has trouble trusting anyone, and he does eventually find ways to bring people in.\nAnd that's really the point of the film. It's not the literal fight with Creed, it's Rocky discovering his connections to other people who do genuinely love him, namely Adrian. It's about him discovering for himself that he's not a bum and that he could go the distance against Creed, last all fifteen rounds. It's not about winning. It's about proving that he belongs in that field, that he hasn't wasted the last six years of his life fighting to get nowhere. It's weird how a film where the hero doesn't actually win a fight can end up so affirming.\nI will say for a moment, that I found the direction rather pedestrian at best. I wouldn't really comment on it much normally, except that Avildsen won Best Director at the Oscars. I have no problem with Rocky winning Best Picture, I'd probably have voted for it, but I cannot imagine Avildsen deserving that Best Director award, especially up against Syndey Lumet for Network. I often at least partially attribute good performances to directors who can help mold the work of actors, so I cannot dismiss him completely here. The actors are all very good, and that's part of the package, but this really does feel like, overall, Avildsen getting a raw and very good script fall into his lap and largely just not screwing it up. I'm fine with that as a result, but it just kind of irritates me that Avildsen beat Lumet.\nI don't think that Avildsen's direction is a drag on the film, though. It's nothing special, but the strength is the script and performances, and they really get a lot of help from Conti's score. I have a major soft spot for Conti's music (like on Huston's Escape to Victory), and it's largely absent from the first hour, only getting an early show during the opening credits before slowly filtering in towards the buildup to the fight. Of course, the fight itself isn't the point, it's Rocky proving himself, and that's the ultimately victory. That it becomes so satisfying is really wonderful.\nJust, please, don't make any sequels, Sly. Rocky doesn't need it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e4a783f0cdafc9b440,tt0075148,Rocky,NoDakTatum,27 October 2023,8,"One of Sylvester Stallone's best films put him on the map, and launched a very successful franchise. Stallone wrote and stars as Rocky Balboa, a down-and-out fighter getting beat up in smoky clubs for chump change. He has a love/hate relationship with his friend Paulie (Burt Young), loves Paulie's sister Adrian (Talia Shire), and enforces payments to loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is looking for a title fight to celebrate the nation's bicentennial, but his opponent drops out. He and promoter Jergens (Thayer David) cook up a plan- give any mook a shot at the champ, in the name of the American way. Balboa is chosen, and Creed goes about the financial business of being a champ, not taking Rocky seriously. Rocky enlists the help of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a gym owner who saw Rocky's potential many years before, but the two never acted on it. As the fight draws near, Rocky's relationship with Paulie deteriorates as his love for Adrian takes center stage.\nI had not seen the original ""Rocky"" in decades. I highly recommend the crisp widescreen DVD transfer, which puts all the videotape releases to shame. I literally forgot what a dark and grim film this is. Rocky's Philadelphia neighborhood is a bit run down, his apartment is a pit, and director John G. Avildsen captures it all perfectly, which is strange considering the almost comic book style of the sequels. Stallone does a fine scripting job. While Rocky's relationship with Adrian takes a while, and the volatile Paulie is never explored too much, Stallone seems to know what the film audience wants. I always thought the fight at the end of the film was longer, but it barely makes ten or fifteen minutes. Weathers' Apollo is not as big a jerk as I remember, until he gets into the ring and must put on his show. Adrian could not be mousier, even with Mickey ears and a tail, but her transformation is believable without being jarring. Young and Meredith also turn in fine performances, not yet the one dimensional characters the sequels would turn them in to. ""Rocky"" is not a excellent film. It is certainly a strong film, full of solid acting, writing, and directing. While I cannot fault any one ingredient for keeping it from being perfect, I do highly recommend it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

Rocky, as I found, is not the stereotypical macho figure you might think: even though he is a boxer with the classic ''tough guy"" look, he often shows his most sensitive and fragile sides, which makes him a role model in many ways. I really liked the way they developed his love story with Adriana, because this side storyline was made almost as important as the main one, creating some balance and avoiding making it an action movie.\nEven though the movie came out in 1976 it is still perfectly enjoyable and the values it conveys are still relevant to our society nowadays, which to me makes it a timeless classic.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

It's filmed on a shoestring budget, it seems. Stallone's ""acting"" is obnoxious. Adrian is a dead fish with zero personality or energy that he basically stalks. Carl Weathers is the best part of this movie and the only thing in it worth watching.\nI do give it credit for the ending. I knew it was coming, but considering when this came out I'm impressed they ended it like they did. Maybe that's part of the problem. This movie has been hyped up to me my whole life. Rocky is this great bit of pop culture history, something I had never seen and now, finally marking it off the list and frankly, I was bored. I wanted it to be over. I imagine if I had the nostalgia to back it up, maybe this would be a different story but without that, it was really an underwhelming flick.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

They usually have this raw, genuine and unflinching feel to them that is so gripping to watch. It's the handheld camera sort of feel and the lack of screen filters that I find refreshing. This movie is no exception to that. I would even say it's one of the grittiest-looking movies I've ever seen. It's impressive to think that Sylvester wrote the whole story for this movie. The dialogue and the way a lot of the characters interact with one another is fantastic - some of it is actually pretty clever and funny. The chemistry between the actors feels great, it's a good energy. Sylvester definitely has a charm and charisma and it shows. I really liked Adrian, the shy girl Rocky ends up falling for - she was really cute. And Pauly is hilarious. This is one of the best underdog stories ever. It's about a humble guy with a good heart and a natural talent who's going nowhere in life but gets his big break, an opportunity of a lifetime. It's an inspirational and feel-good movie with a good heart. The cinematography was actually beautifully done - very well thought out. Especially the shots of the city and environment. It was kind of cheesy how Rocky would walk around everywhere punching the air, but I guess it adds to his characters charm. That last training sequence will forever be iconic and I can see why it's such a staple in pop culture. I can't believe it took me 32 years to watch this movie, but I'm glad I finally did. I enjoyed it and I can see why it's so iconic and so well-regarded.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

The acting is superb, the casting also is great, the teenagers all actually look like teenagers in this film. Everything just feels nice and natural, the editing is good, the clothes and music are so 1980s. The lighting and fog on the beach when the boys on their motorbikes make their entrance, with the music playing alone is so iconic.

The heart of the film, a story centered on an unlikely friendship that bridges the gap of ages and cultures, continues to resonate with me. Pat Morita's portrayal of Mr. Miyagi is an absolute standout. His ability to teach Ralph Macchio's character, Daniel, not only the art of fighting but also the deeper philosophy and patience behind it is truly impressive.\nDirected by John G. Avildsen, the creative mind behind the camera for Rocky, the movie carries a familiar underdog vibe that I've always appreciated. It's evident that the DNA of his earlier 1976 film is imprinted on The Karate Kid, from the training montages to the triumphant journey that leaves you rooting for the protagonist.\nWhile the film mostly hits the mark, there are moments where the pacing falters. This, combined with some clichéd dialogue and stereotypical story beats hold the film back from outright glory. However, considering the film's vintage, some of these elements kind of add to its nostalgic charm.\nThe training and tournament scenes are where the movie truly shines, keeping me engaged and invested in Daniel's growth. The relationship developed over the course of the film enhances the emotional impact of these pivotal moments, reminding me why this film became such a classic in the first place.\nUltimately, The Karate Kid continues to hold its own, delivering powerful messages about mentorship, friendship, and self-discovery. Despite its minor flaws, it remains a must-watch for anyone who enjoys martial arts, life lessons, and a dash of 80s nostalgia.

Not only is this a great coming-of-age story, but it's a very competent sport and underdog story that is so fittingly directed by the man who created the quintessential underdog sports film, Rocky.\nPat Morita is so great as Mr Miyagi and his chemistry with Ralph Macchio who gives a more than competent performance as Daniel LaRusso is the beating heart of the film. Throughout the entire film, there wasn't one moment where I wasn't convinced these two were like father and son, sure some cheesy moments arise due to this but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't smiling whenever they were together.\nI like how the main character isn't your ideal lead, especially in a sports film, Daniel LaRusso is a lanky and unwealthy teenager that has no father and rough origins that are exacerbated by bullying when he leaves Newark for California. He befriends the maintenance guy at his residence who eventually teaches him karate and becomes a role model and a father figure in his life. He's someone that people can easily relate to especially when you throw in his complicated love life.\nThe soundtrack for the film is just as good as the training montages which are a joy to watch.

This film is the perfect example of what the highly touted iconic words ""The American Dream"" stands for. You got a very highly skilled football player who had a very bright future, finds a beautiful & supportive significant partner, but then everything came crashing down early on & along the way hes lost in his downward spiral, barely hanging on & struggling. We get to see the hardships endured by Kurt, while he forges deeper bonds with so many around him.\nWhether minor characters or major characters you get to witness enter his life & its as if each of them were meant to be Gods hand in pushing Kurt on the right track, no matter if its just simple words of encouragement or new opportunities that come knocking.

Though I obviously logically knew how the film plays out, but I felt shivers & chills course through my body, full of excitement & energy as you watch the underdog trying to claw its way back up with everything to lose on the line & making his last push towards success... it was heartwarming honestly.\nOh ya Great acting by uh the Shazam guy & awesome acting by the woman that plays his wife.

American Underdog is different I would argue because the theme of faith makes up the foundation of the film, while not being overwhelming or preachy.

He watched Super Bowl XIX and he decides that he will play in the NFL and win a Super Bowl and MVP.\nSo years later Kurt is the quarterback for the University of Northern Iowa. He plays 5 years and he has very good stats as the starting quarterback. He is so sure he will be picked in the NFL draft... But one team after another, every team passes him over.\nKurt went through several NFL tryouts with various teams but to no avail. So Kurt goes to work for a local grocery store. But he never gave up, and gets a offer to play Arena Football. Kurt became a star QB of that league. He even made the Arena Football Hall of Fame.\nSoon Kurt's fame spread and reaches the NFL scouts. Finally the door is open to his dream. Dick Vermeil, coach of the Rams goes against his entire staff and signs Kurt Warner as the Rams backup quarterback.\n""I just want my shot. I want one chance to prove that I'm good enough"" - Kurt\nWhen the Rams starting QB is injured, Kurt steps in and becomes the starter. Oh and not just a starting QB, Kurt won a Super Bowl, Super Bowl MVP, and NFL MVP.\nAs much as Kurt loves playing football and receiving all the awards. He placed his family first and gives them credit, having the people you love to stand by you through all the struggles.\n""It doesn't mean anything if you don't have someone to share it with"" - Kurt\nI really enjoined this underdog movie.

Will this novel and - to many - controversial approach pay off?\nIn form and structure, Moneyball is a familiar underdog story which have been known to work ever so well many times before on the big-screen. However, this is no Rocky with lots of action and simple, emotional dialogue. And it's no Youngblood style of film in which the game itself is simplified to attract ""regular"" viewers. On the contrary, Moneyball is something as rare as a sports film about numbers and tactics. It's not only based on real-life people and events, but it also treats and presents these people and events accordingly, and not through a conventionalized archetype-filter. A film as technical and theory-oriented as this one may sound inaccessible to outsiders, but as a typical European soccer-fan with minimal knowledge about the game of baseball, I say on the contrary. This is a breath of fresh air in a world of movie-making which often underestimates its viewers. Moneyball is a detailed and fairly fast-paced account from an environment about which the filmmakers are never afraid to be specific and comprehensive. And this works as a perfect counterweight to the heart and moral of the story, which is undeniably simplistic, but also inherently beautiful.\nBrad Pitt gives arguably the best performance of his career as real-life GM Billy Beane. His performance has a drive and a carefreeness which I haven't seen in Pitt for years, and combined with appropriate mannerisms and a clearly deep understanding of the character, he gives the film the momentum it needs. Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman complement him with fine supporting work in a film which puts Aaron Sorkin's edgy dialogue to the best use that it has been since A Few Good Men. And the fine directing job is credited to Bennett Miller (of Capote) and he conveys the script, which Sorkin co-wrote with Steve Zaillian, with a clear focus about what he wants to accomplish, handling the sentimental and the bittersweet with equal aptitude.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

6595b4e4a783f0cdafc9b460,tt1210166,Moneyball,amanbirsingh,4 August 2023,7,"This sports drama represents the peak of the American indie cinema movement of the early 21st century led by Newline Cinema but not without affecting the rhythm and tone of the film. It portrays a sociopath baseball coach (Pitt) with bigger dreams than his university skills can allow. And so he spends most of his time lobbying for a sponsorship for a pathetic team of boys and for some salvation along the way in a moneyballed league. The film then circles around to focus not on the rules of the game but more on the human side to life. It grows out of its immature shell exactly as the director wants and to the approval of the audience into serious and compelling cinema.\nThe film balances itself solely on the experienced shoulders of Brad Pitt. A word must be said about how impactful the acting is as he emotes his way through the crisis that he does not deserve. Moneyball is a tearful script but still a badly made film. It has ordinary lines and the scenes drag themselves with no special effort from the director and his team and it seems as if Pitt should be encouraging them instead of the players. Sadly in this case, it is just not uplifting enough.\nA poignant thought arises about the two important dimensions of any game, the unbroken will of an individual and the sacrifices that are made by members of a team. Moneyball hints at these qualities as it seeks to elucidate the tenets of human adventurism. The theme of the film unaltered, it falls into the list of the stoic Clint Eastwood hero but very much for the new age in this case.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

GM of the Oakland team Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) is in conflict with his scout group due his disagreement over selection of players. He feels that the methods used are outdated and subjective.( Scouts would typically use 5 tools for evaluation, that is can he run, field, throw , hit and hit with power ? ) Billy meets smart young Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill), a Yale economics graduate who uses saber economics methods rather than discussion and brain storming to evaluate the players. Using economics and statistics Billy and Peter then form a team to weed out non effective players and recruit lower valued but promising players much to the displeasure of their scouts group. Initially there are reverses ( teething problems ) but things start looking up with many wins along the way.\nDirector Bennet Miller uses the talents of both Brad and Jonah to set up an engaging narrative of plans, promises,efforts, firings, recruitments, conflicts, victory, defeat ,frustration etc. There are interesting scenes on what happens behind the scenes during formation of baseball teams with budget constraints and the strategies used in order to win. Brad Pitt performs superbly as the impatient, curt, terse, animated, GM who won't accept no for an anwer.( I hate losing ,he says). He doesn't watch matches himself in a type of superstition. His love for baseball makes him say "" How can you not be romantic about baseball ?. Brad must have a scene in his films where he is eating, has his mouth full and says his dialogue.

This picture was even nominated in the Best Film category at the Golden Globe Awards, but lost to the film 12 Years a Slave. A serious opponent who could not be bypassed. Nevertheless, Howard's project became a memorable work in the careers of all involved.\nIn the ""Rush"", the excellent acting and successful directorial vision create a rich and exciting world. Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda go beyond the simple embodiment of the characters, and their characters come to life. Charismatic characters allow the viewer to feel the inner fire of rivalry and passion for victory.\nHemsworth, known for his appearance and charm, convincingly conveys the passion and audacity of his character, creating an image of an intriguing and often uncomfortable hero for others. Involuntarily, a comparison with the famous hero Thor, whom Hemsworth has been playing for many years, suggests itself. Here, under the appearance of Thor, there is a completely different character, into which the actor has so successfully reincarnated. Chris's excellent performance, a worthy role that will forever remain in his career as one of the strongest.\nDaniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda perfectly conveys the character of this legendary racer. His acting work is characterized by precision and depth, revealing not only Lauda's professional qualities, but also his inner world, including difficult moments in his personal life.\nThe script of the film is masterfully written, paying attention not only to racing and high speed, but also to the deep human relationships underlying the story. This balance between competition and friendship creates a touching and exciting aspect that manages to be conveyed in every frame.\nTechnically, the painting was created with great care. Decent editing and soundtrack give the film a special status, taking it to a new level, especially in the racing scenes, where the viewer almost physically feels the speed and adrenaline.\nEspecially impressive is the attention to detail in the visual design of the film, recreating the style of the 1970s. Costumes, cars, scenery - everything embodies the atmosphere of that era and gives the film a unique character. And the color correction is deliberately specially selected in such a way that the viewer feels like he is watching a 1970s movie.\nBut, of course, one of the main achievements of the ""Rush"" is the exciting racing scenes. They not only immerse the viewer into the world known even to people who are not interested in Formula 1, but also convey the extreme sensations and risks associated with this sport.\nRon Howard's compositional work is an art that can pull the viewer into the dynamic world of race tracks and at the same time remain true to the deep human aspects of the story. The director's vision of the director deserves the highest praise. He expertly handles Peter Morgan's script, immersing the viewer in the intriguing world of Formula 1 and at the same time paying attention to human relationships. Howard emphasizes emotional moments and moves from exciting racing scenes to deep reflections of the characters with ease, as if playfully, not allowing the viewer to understand where the transition from action to drama and back happens.\nThe director not only gives the viewer the opportunity to feel the adrenaline of racing, but also delves into the psychology and motivation of the characters. He carefully balanced the dynamic racing moments with the touching and meaningful scenes between Hunt and Lauda, creating a harmonious piece.\nThe painting is remembered for another important aspect - the work of Hans Zimmer. It has long been no secret to me that the projects to which the composer puts his hand are literally doomed to success. I love Zimmer's music, and it's very good here. The musical work in the film adds an additional layer of emotional saturation and enhances the visual range.\nHans Zimmer, known for his unique style and sense of rhythm, created a soundtrack that perfectly matches the dynamics of the racing scenes and at the same time skillfully emphasizes the internal conflicts of the characters. His compositions in the film seem to become a separate character who actively interacts with the plot and conveys subtle interweaving of emotions. The picture is not limited only to visual and acting aspects, but also includes the musical magic of Hans Zimmer.\n""Rush"" is not just an ordinary film about professionals driving, of which there are probably a dozen. This is a great real story about friendship, passion, overcoming oneself and difficulties. Director Ron Howard has created a work that can delight and inspire, even those who are not fans of the world of racing. The painting is still remembered with interest, even a decade after viewing. This is an exciting journey that leaves an indelible impression and causes deep admiration for the work of the entire team, and, most importantly, opens up the real stories of Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the average viewer.\n9 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

The racing is very well shot and keeps you interested in the intense rivalry on the track as well as the personal differences off of it.\nI would say it tries to put the characters too much into their box to keep the narrative of the film (Lauda being hyper geeky, unlikable, boring, intense etc, and Hunt the polar opposite). But otherwise a well shot movie with a good pace that didn't drag.\nIt's a rare type of film for this age so I'm happy to be educated as well as entertained by this overlooked sporting rivalry from the 1970's.\n8/10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,

I don't know how.\nIf it was on the level of directing from the oppressed director Roaword, the thing that caught my attention the most was his choice of actors, because after the movie I couldn't imagine anyone in their place playing these characters, and Chris Hemsworth was a really good choice and very appropriate. I couldn't imagine anyone in his place, and this is his best performance in his career, in my opinion, and the same.

Seriously, if you looked up ""generic"" in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure you'd find a picture of this film's poster right beside it. It's exactly what you expect it to be, and it's not even a notably strong version of that. It's really tempting to dock significant points from my score simply because of how uninventive and safe it is. However, and this is a big however, the flick is just good-natured, warm-hearted, solidly executed family fun that puts a smile on your face and keeps you engaged for its undeniably excessive runtime. It isn't deep or important or thematically rich or keenly observed, it's just a simple slice of uplifting fluff that knows what it needs to do and does it fairly well. 'Champions (2023)' is kept afloat by its strong ensemble cast (lead by a grumpy but easy-to-like Woody Harrelson) and its ability to be inclusive without being patronising, allowing its various disabled characters (portrayed by real disabled actors, something which should be a given but sadly isn't) to exist beyond their disabilities and emerge as rounded individuals with character arcs and memorable scenes that don't just reduce them to caricatures. It just gets right what most movies get wrong, which is worth praising even if it's actually the bare minimum a piece of media can do. It's hard not to be won over by it when all is said and done. Of course, it's far from fantastic. It comes with a lot of the same issues that plague its near-identical predecessors, and it's only ever so engaging. Still, it's undeniably enjoyable and sweet (without being particularly cloying), which is really all that it needs to be.

The comedy is over the top hilarious, and the hotheaded and short fused Gilmore is a such a lovable character that by the end you will be wishing there was a sequel. There is a lot of memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie, and Sandler's fight with Bob Barker has become legendary.\nThis is one of those films that just had everything needed for a great comedy, If you haven't seen this before, I would highly recommend checking out.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e4a783f0cdafc9b479,tt0116483,Happy Gilmore,ms-48528-39026,6 November 2023,9,"Happy Gilmore is a classic comedy that shows a young hockey player who has an extremely short temper and is not afraid to use it. Happy is introduced to golf and discovers he has a unique talent. Happy then joins the tour and meets his soon to be rival Scooter McGavin, who is extremely competitive and plays with an edge. Scooter is the man in the golfing world and Happy challenges his dominance on the course. Adam Sandler does a terrific job and he keeps you laughing throughout the entire movie.\nAfter watching this film I think the storyline is very unique and I love the comedic aspect of it. Adam Sandler does a terrific job keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire movie and you never know what to expect next which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Shooter McGavin, played by Christopher McDonald, is an excellent complement to Happy Gilmore with both of them having an excellent sense of humor and knowing how to deliver it the correct way. Something I think could have been done better is showing more of Scooter and how he is looked at by the golf world. Scooter is portrayed as a dominant player but I think his life before Happy Gilmore was not shown enough in the beginning of the film. Adam Sandler has other sports movies and I can see a correlation between Happy Gilmore and The Longest Yard, another favorite of mine. In both movies, Adam Sandler comes together with other athletes to accomplish something that he needs to get done. Golf is the ultimate individual sport and this film does an excellent job of showing how real life golf can get in the way of tournaments being neck to neck and feeling tension during the later parts of the round. Happy Gilmore is a film directed at anyone who enjoys sports and putting its own spin on it with its way of comedy and how it is incorporated into certain parts of the film. It is a family friendly film so anyone can watch it. The director, Dennis Dugan, did a great job adding his own creative twists to different scenes of the movie and having the cast with the ability to execute these to the best of its potential makes for a very entertaining film.\nTo end this review I think Dennis Dugan, Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, and everyone on the cast of Happy Gilmore did a superb job putting together a film that shows you a fun side to golf and delivered a very humorous filled comedy that I would say was a hole-in-one. To rate this film I would give it a 9/10 because it is one of my favorite movies ever and I love comedies so this movie was my type of movie.

This movie made me laugh. That's a tough thing to do considering I'm not big into comedies, especially nowadays where comedy has lost its raunchiness. I'd say the funniest parts of the movie (in my opinion) is when Happy (Sandler) has his temper tantrums out on the golf course.

Matt Busby was the manager of Manchester United Football Club, who lost their team of starlets (known as The Busby Babes) to the Munich air crash of 1958. Busby would then go on to rebuild the team and make them into a world force, one that still exists today. Here he is in long retirement exile, but still moulding young football minds. It's based on true events.\nWe have a heavy dose of sentimentality on offer here, not just with the flashbacks to the tragic loss of The Busby Babes, but also to the working class kids of terrace housed Manchester. Of single parents trying to make ends meet, of kids with absent fathers erring on the wrong side of the law, education a dangled carrot just out of reach.\nHowever, the sentimentality is not cloying, it's well handled and performed, but the pic never gets to uplift status. It has some good laughs in the mix, usually when Toby Stephens' pompous school tutor is on screen, while the ultimate conclusion - even though it's what we expect - warms the cockles, but it never branches out to be more than just a family film for kiddies who like football, or for Manchester folk eager for anything involving Sir Matt Busby. \nIt makes for a decent ""B"" movie support to There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, though not nearly as good as that film.

It all felt very low budget, the acting was fine but far to clichéd, but if you're a kid you prob wont notice.\nBasically, I would avoid this film if you're expecting a decent football film and you are above the age of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b50,,,,,
6595b4e4a783f0cdafc9b486,tt9603212,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,garethcrook,2 January 2024,4,"Dangerous dudes have a deadly stealth weapon on a state of the art submarine. They're Russian, of course. No one can find them, it's... impossible. Twaddle obviously as someone or something hacks their computer and they wind up dead in the water. It's classic action movie intro and this is a classic action movie. I've lost count of where we are in the series and I'm not sure I've seen them all, but it doesn't matter. There's enough back story thrown in to keep even newcomers up to speed and the story slows every now and then to cram in some clunky dialogue ensuring no one gets lost. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a secret agent type working for IMF, a shadowy organisation that looks after the world, keeping the oblivious masses safe from evil. He's tasked to find a key that unlocks that deadly weapon now sat at the bottom of the ocean. A simple enough premise. These films rarely get complicated. The point is the visual spectacle. Car chases through Rome, gun fights in swirling sand storms and runaway trains. Blink and you'll miss something. It probably won't be important, but it might be fun. Cruise handles the action and the pithy one liners, whilst Mark Gatiss covers some of the espionage plot. Outlining to Cary Elwes and other suits that the real danger is a sentient AI hiding its secrets on that sunken sub, how very modern. Find the key, control the weapon, keep the good guys safe, but who are the good guys, who can be trusted. Certainly no government. Hunt and his team, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), the most unlikely trio, set out to find both parts of the key and what it unlocks and kill it before anyone can use it for themselves. It's basically a string of set pieces. Sequences are kept separate to let you catch your breath, but when the action gets cooking, it leans hard on the gas, intercutting chases, with guns being pointed and bombs counting down. It's like Bond, less dramatic, a little more fun, not as clever. The supporting cast are mostly solid. The set pieces are nicely choreographed and the cinematography dialled up to eleventy stupid. It's not without its issues though. It's indulgently long and this is only part one. There's zero justification for this, other than ego (how many minutes do we really need to see Cruise running) and money at the box office. Vanessa Kirby as the wonderful named White Widow scrapes by as one of many villains. Esai Morales too as Gabriel, a fantastical character prone to philosophical claptrap, clearly meant to be an angel of death. It's ticks along well enough, but it's all surface. You don't really care about the characters and some quick cuts and rousing music are not enough to inject any empathy or drama. Two and a hour hours later, nothing much has been achieved other than Cruise getting to have some fun skydiving. I've no idea when part two is due, to be honest I don't really care.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,,

The film rubbed me the wrong way. However I believe my expectations were way too high and was not prepared for a smart story, so in my ignorance I got bored. I refused to see the good. The interesting part here though is that days, weeks and months passed where I couldn't shake the feeling that it was unfair to abandon the movie completely. So I decided to give it another chance at home, alone. This is when it all began to make sense. I finally got the intelligence the movie carried and suddenly I felt guilty for not having giving it a proper chance.

The essential element was that seemingly impossible missions were made possible by carefully thought out means. While those means might stretch credulity, they still carried a plausibility and attention to detail that were critical to the franchise. The technology, logistics and psychological deceptions were clever. Fast forward to the present and every bit of cleverness and plausibility has evaporated. Nothing really makes sense: escapes depend on ridiculously convenient events; truly impossible tech appears instantly as needed; action sequences continually defy physics. There can be no suspense when magical interventions are easily at hand and guaranteed.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,,

The entire filming was struck with bad luck. If not, don't worry - I will fill you in. If you already know or don't care - skip the next paragraph.\nSo, this movie and The Batman were hit the hardest during filming due to the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The original plan was to shoot Parts 1 & 2 back to back, but with delays messing up the filming schedule and the budget ballooning to $291 million, making it the most expensive MI film to date. Nicholas Hoult was initially cast as the villain but had to drop out due to his commitments with the TV show The Great. So many crew members contracted COVID-19 that production had to stop for weeks until it eventually started again. Of course, this led to the famous audio rant from Mr. Cruise himself, who yelled at two crew members for not following the rules. Whether you think he was in the right or wrong, it does, however, give us an idea of how stressful it was trying to make a blockbuster during a global pandemic. With the film set in different locations worldwide and the long filming hours, self-isolating during those long months must have been extra tiring.\nBut in the end, it was all worth it.\nIt's 2 hours and 43 minutes long, yet you never feel it. It's got solid pacing - the mark of a good movie. It follows the same formula as the previous films, where a mission goes wrong, and our MI crew must fight all odds to stop a world-ending event, where some people still don't trust Ethan Hunt for whatever reason, despite being right every single time in the past. And yet, it's so entertaining to watch.\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie is the saviour of this franchise, as every entry feels fresh, exciting, and cinematic. McQuarrie understands cinema, the visual language, and the slick rhythm of pace and flow.\nWhile the action did not blow me away like Fallout, it's still fantastic. The last action scene involves train carriages one by one falling off a destroyed bridge. It was the most thrilling thing I have seen. The Rome Chase scene had plenty of thrills and comedy to go around. Funny enough, Fast X filmed a chase scene in the same area in Rome, but the comparison between the two movies is night and day. Fast X looked phony with the overuse of CGI, and it was not thrilling enough. Dead Reckoning, on the other hand, was done more practically and looked so much better. It made better use of the area for the action set pieces. Another comparison is that these two action franchises have been going on for a while now, but one is getting better with each installment while the other is getting dumber.\nHow about the stunt of Cruise throwing himself and his motorbike off a cliff, which the trailers showed to death in the marketing, and it still managed to take my breath away when I saw it in IMAX; not many modern movies do that. Movies like this remind us why we go to the cinema. For the thrill, for the experience.\nI cared about the MI crew. In Dead Reckoning - there is room for emotional depth and always an enjoyable collaboration.\nA newcomer to the series, Hayley Atwell, is a standout and gave an excellent performance. The funny thing is, she isn't a 20-something newcomer to the film scene or anything like that, as she has already starred in big movies before this, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And yet, this feels like a breakout role. Those movies did her dirty.\nPom Klementieff is another newcomer to the series, as the silent but deadly henchman. Most of her character is a mystery but intriguing screen presence.\nWith the main threat being AI, it never felt timelier than ever, even though the script was finished before all the AI mess started to take effect. What is even more perfect for the film's message is that this came out around the Writers and Actors strike, with one of the reasons the strike happened was that movie studios are pushing AI to take over people's jobs. This movie feels like a big middle finger to AI and higher-ups using it.\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie's love for cinema, style, mixture of genres, stunt work, language, and flow with pacing has benefited this series ever since he took over this franchise. The action was exciting, and the score was fantastic. It has been nearly 30 years since this franchise started, and it keeps improving.\nI do have issues with the film. I admire the real stunt work from behind the scenes, but the use of CGI overshadows the realness of the stunt work, and it's easy to think most of it was on a computer. As I said earlier, it's nowhere near as great as Fallout, as I thought the action scenes and pacing to be better.\nOther than that, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a solid entry in one of the best action franchises.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b51,,,,,

Yet somehow, it's fate is tied to one piece of hardware. I would have expected far more originality for such a big production. On the small scale, the plot is littered with a way too many moments where suspending disbelief is the only way to get through. Everyone is an expert pickpocket. Accept all law enforcement personnel, who are totally incompetent. On the whole, a very predictable, unimaginative movie.

The tearing off of the face to reveal somebody different underneath the mask. The first one or two times they did that it was cool but on the sixth or seventh time, it really gets old. Another thing I couldn't stand, is where they look at each other and use their eyes to ""point"" to something with that stupid, surprised or concerned look on their faces. I thought to myself ""how many times are they gonna do the idiot thing with the eyes? Are they gonna do this through the whole movie?"".. I don't know why, but it was just driving me crazy in the one LONG scene!!! Maybe no one else noticed it? But now that I pointed it out, you will notice it.

That is physically impossible, considering the small size of the car and the impossibility for them to float up, while the car was trumbling, then land in each other's seats, come on! 2) The high-speed steam train cannot continue traveling for long, after Gabriel killed the controller who was supposed to continuously provide the steamer with coal or diesel and that is how steam trains operate. 3) When Ethan and Gabriel were fighting on the top of the train, with Gabriel facing the direction of train movement, Gabriel laid down to avoid being struck by the fast-approaching bridge edge. Then Ethan turned his head to realize the same thing and then also laid down. There should not be enough time for Ethan to look behind and then lay down, he would have already been struck by the bridge edge.

However, if you're looking for an action film, I wouldn't say this is the right one. Those seeking this type of plot typically want to see many shooting scenes, and while they do occur here, they're not as frequent as expected because the film focuses more on moments of tension. In contrast, violence is consistently present, whether in torture scenes, murder, or shootouts. I would describe this plot as dramatic, bloody, with a considerable dash of action.\nIt's an almost perfect experience for those seeking intense on-screen tension, a good period film, and numerous references to characters that have shaped history.\nPersonally, I loved the direction, plot, and characters, with a significant highlight on the memorable antagonist.\nHowever, upon finishing the movie, I felt that something was missing. I think this film could have delved deeper into the protagonist and their allies. At times, the plot doesn't even seem to have a clear protagonist, as it focuses more on other settings and characters than on the main character. On one hand, this could be considered a negative aspect, but for me, it suited the storyline well, ultimately exploring a bit of everything.

It felt like combining Mission Impossible, John Wick, and a book of adult jokes in one. I can safely say that the script was very weak, the dialogues were used, and unoriginal. The story is a very confusing concept, too. Starting off with a totally pathetic intro, and then a really strange bar scene that was completely unnecessary, and after that some bloody action and romantic fights of some sort. What I'm trying to say is that the beginning was very unsure, it didn't go anywhere, and the first part was clearly ment to be just a time filler with unnecessary scenes. The second part was the beginning to the third, nothing really special happened there, some fun jokes sometimes but besides that, not much. Then came the third act, and things changed totally. I got much more interested, the action sequences were amazingly made, in some sort of John Wick style, but not totally, and I really enjoyed the 1v1 fights, especially with the great music they did in the background. The camera angles and the fighting techniques were good, the shooting sequences were fine, but less interesting that the nunchaku/knife fights. The story was somehow better developed here, something that didn't happen before, we are getting some sort of character development, and I think that's very important, and I'm happy we get just something of it, but I wished more. Most of the movie took place on a warm deserts or a big container ship, and I think that it was ok filming locations for such a film. I wished better acting, but it could have been worse. Jason Statham was the leading point, he was ok, he had humor, overall decent. Sylvester Stallone came more in and out, he was more of a fun addition to the film but I can't say he played any good, I would even say completely plastic and unrealistic. The rest of the cast were either fighters or soldiers-to-kill. Does Soldiers-to-kill are random people that has chosen to play just to shoot and get shot. Nothing really special, in my opinion, I wonder if they were even written in the credits. After all, The Expendables 4 (or Expend4bles) was a decent action comedy, the script was pathetic, even dumb, the acting was basic, but the film was saved by fun humor, decent music, and great action sequences, that really entertains.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

But this is so blatantly bad. I think they filmed the entire thing on a green screen. The CGI blood is hilarious. They even use CGI for a plane. Can't afford to use a real one in your ""action"" movie?\n4) They do a practical stunt with a AFV jumping a ramp, which looks endlessly better. Only problem, there is absolutely zero reason for them to launch off the ramp. One of the shots even shows another car drive around the ramp. And the ramp itself is a hilariously smooth pile of rubble, complete with a tank sticking out of it.\n5) The action sucks. Nothing stands out aside from all the fight scenes with Tony Jaa or Iko Uwais. Statham is decent too. Everything else is useless.\n6) The music adds nothing. I forgot it was even there.\n7) 50 Cent.\n8) Even in 2023, the writers still give the black character lines like, ""that's what I'm talking about,"" and, ""snitches get stitches.""

It follows three Vietnam veterans traveling together to bury the Marine son of one of them who has just died in Iraq.\n""Last Flag Flying"" has three principal characters. Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Steve Carell) was still a teenager when fighting in Vietnam. An incident involving the other two men resulted in his military imprisonment for two years before a dishonorable discharge. His wife, with whom he had a good marriage, has recently died of breast cancer. His son, Larry Jr., was just killed in Iraq. Doc has a lower-level clerical position and seems naturally quiet and introverted.\nAfter decades of no contact, Doc locates his two former comrades to ask them to join him in receiving Larry, Jr.'s body at Dover Air Force Base and probable burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) is a cynical, rough-hewn bar owner in Newport News with a metal plate in his head that may have impacted his confrontative personality. Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) discovered evangelical faith after leaving the Marines and is now the pastor of an African American Baptist church in Virginia.\nThe film follows Doc's efforts to engage his former comrades and their travels together to receive Larry Jr.'s body and ultimately take it to New Hampshire after he learns more about his son's death. During the movie, we learn more about the critical event in Vietnam. Key secondary characters include Colonel Willits (Yul Vazquez), a manipulative Marine officer; Corporal Charlie Washington (J. Quinton Johnson), Larry Jr.'s best friend in the Marines; and the U-haul truck rental clerk (Jane Mowder).\n""Last Flag Flying"" is slow-paced but appropriately unfolds each character's personality. Larry warms up as their time together lengthens, and Sal and Richard come to greater accommodation after surviving earlier sparks. Sal introduces humor to the drama, and there is one great scene where they all remember a trip to ""Disneyland.""\nThe events around the U-haul truck rental don't work, though it's crucial to the plot. There are also a few wonky edges to the ending. But all-in-all, ""Last Flag Flying"" is a first-rate story about three guys who served their country, don't regret it, but are very cynical about what their government is doing in foreign lands.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Secondly, it stars Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne, all of whom do a terrific job. And thirdly, the film is an unofficial sequel to Hal Ashby's The Last Detail, a movie that I first discovered just a few years ago and became a big fan of.\nLast Flag Flying is both a funny and touching film that explores powerful themes such as grief, patriotism, and friendship. Linklater does a remarkable job balancing humor with drama and the chemistry between our main cast is exceptional. Steve Carell in particular gives a remarkably gentle and sympathetic performance that honestly made me well up at times. I love seeing him take on more dramatic roles. I'm sure he will get that silly gold statue at some point in his career, he's too talented not to.\nAs I mentioned prior, Last Flag Flying is an unofficial sequel to The Last Detail. Both films were based on books by Darryl Ponicsan. I believe in the book, Last Flag Flying, the three lead characters are the same ones from The Last Detail and the novel revolves around them decades later after the first story. Now, as much as I would've enjoyed seeing a proper sequel to The Last Detail, it simply wouldn't have worked without bringing back Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, and Otis Young. So I think the decision to make this film a stand-alone movie with different characters that utilize the same themes as the first film was a good idea.\nMy only real nitpick for Last Flag Flying is that it could've easily had 15 minutes or so cut out, which would've tightened up the pacing. And because of the movie's slow pace and serious subject matter, it's not a film I see myself returning to all that often. But regardless, I think Last Flag Flying is a very well-made film with great direction by Linklater and awesome performances from our lead cast. If you're a fan of The Last Detail and you've yet to see Last Flag Flying, you should check it out.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

The three are very different characters who haven't seen each other in a long time, but through the course of the film build an incredible loving friendship again - not without much drama, argument and no little hilarity along the way.\nThe film is apparently a sequel of sorts to Hal Ashby's 'The Last Detail' starring Jack Nicholson and slthough they are largely unconnected, the spirit certainly remains. Whilst the story of getting Carrell's son back home in defiance of marine protocol which wants him at Arlington, this is in many ways a bit of a maguffin. What keeps this so fresh and alive is the three utterly glorious characters we stay with throughout the film and the terrific performances by 3 great actors. It is often very dramatic and indeed quite touching without getting cloying and at times, utterly hilarious - their recollections of Carrell losing his virginity are just so funny. The 3 though, Cranston, alcoholic and brimming with good humour, Fishburne, a priest who has forgotten joy and finds it and possibly best of all Carrell, in the quietest of the three parts, struggling with his loss are such good company and that's the reason for watching this - the great company.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Doc asks his two friends to accompany him to pick up the remains of his son, a Marine killed in Iraq. The three men set out on an odyssey to have the young man buried and to perhaps put some old ghosts to rest themselves.\nThis was based on the 2003 novel by Darryl Ponicsan, which was a sequel to his 1970 novel The Last Detail, which was memorably filmed in 1973 with Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid. Linklater, who co-wrote the script with Ponicsan, decided to alter this follow-up in several ways, changing the character names and a lot of their back story, but the essential dynamic is the same. I enjoyed this film well enough, but as a big fan of The Last Detail, I spent much of this movie's runtime comparing it, and wondering what might have been had this been filmed 15 years ago and with the original film's cast returning to their roles (Otis Young passed away in 2001, before the sequel novel was published). Seeing at least Nicholson and Quaid return in those roles would have been really something else.\nAll that aside, this is still a largely enjoyable movie, with good performances and some nice, quiet character moments. The film seems to want to say something about veterans, and what they feel and how they deal with the rest of their lives, and how they end up viewing their country that they sacrificed for but who may have ultimately been lying to them. However, the script doesn't put these thoughts together in a clear enough fashion to be making any kind of definitive statement, but it may be the case that there really isn't one. It's odd to think that a movie set in 2003 is a period piece, but it is, and much is made of a visit by the three aging buddies to a cell phone store to check out the new-fangled technology. I'm curious how this movie will be viewed by actual Vietnam-era military veterans.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Overall the movie was good and had some great scenes that made it quite enjoyable. The acting was solid for the most part and I'm really convinced Steve Carell can do just about anything. Such a well versed actor. The story has its moments and even though the subject manner is deep, the writers do a decent job keeping it light with some funny moments. The thing that dropped it down a few spots for me is the lack of research when dealing with Marine Corps customs and uniform. All it would take is to have a real Marine on set to give input on do's and don'ts. It won't matter to most but when they screw up the simplest thing of proper hair cuts and NO FREAKIN beards it's just so disrespectful to those of us that wear the uniform and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Anytime they put an actor in a military uniform they should at least get things right. I guarantee that makes a difference on what hundreds of thousands of veterans think about a movie or tv show. Getting things right on appearance is the very least a producer could do. Anyway the movie is good.... Not great but good.

It posits the Americans' selfishness, reckless hubris, and violence as reflective of either their youthful elan or their wounded spirits.

Sign me up for that rollercoaster of action!\nThe film wears its influences proudly, with Quentin Tarantino's stylized violence and segmented story structure leaving their mark. But it's the legacy of Rambo that truly shines through. Jorma Tommila's portrayal of Aatami, an ex-Finnish soldier targeted by retreating Nazis, brings a touch of classic action hero ethos to the story.\nAs Aatami faces off against the ruthless Germans, it's no surprise that things don't end well for them. The action unfolds with a delightful flair, featuring original kills that are both inventive and graphic. It's a feast for fans who relish a bit of cinematic carnage.\nWhile the film delivers undeniably entertaining action, my main gripe surfaces as Aatami's survivability reaches near superhero levels in the escalating confrontations. This aspect, though thrilling, stretches the bounds of credibility, potentially diminishing some of the earlier impact.\nNevertheless, for those seeking a straightforward action film with a unique perspective, Sisu delivers the goods. The film's blend of influences, from Tarantino to the legendary Rambo, results in an action-packed ride that keeps you hooked from start to finish.

I have no doubt this is a good film, but I must find some faults with it. The film is overlong and overly exhausting. One of this films strengths is that its action sequences are so tightly choreographed and well edited that it draws you in easily and you can become easily absorbed by it. The film is hence not exhausting due to technical deficiencies- it becomes slightly too long because its plot does not move much. Neither do their characters grow much. I find Tom Hanks later effort(which he helped produce), Band Of Brothers, to be much better, and perhaps the best media in the genre. Saving Private Ryan lacked the camaraderie, the kinship, and it also lacked the war drama or the insightful observations about war seen in band of brothers. While there is some profound insights in dialogue between characters in the film, it never felt as heartfelt or touching as that in the miniseries. To me, Saving Private Ryan felt too straightforward and empty in its storytelling- there are little to no complications involved in this adventure. Of course, I cannot doubt that this is a landmark film, a film which almost all subsequent war productions earn a debt to. It is bloody, visceral, and devastating in how it portrays the horrors of war. It's action is also so competently done and so enthralling that it has the ability to absorb one in. But it is still a film with a plot that does not earn its 3 hour runtime.

The opening beach attack scene with it's lack and score and just the sound of the German machine gun rattling away was and is in my opinion the best filmed war scene I've ever seen.

While watching the struggle of these soldiers, whose arms and legs were torn to pieces and thrown around, under the rain of bullets, I thought for a moment that these situations were actually happening, even if I was not a soldier of my own country. How bad and painful the war was. I think the message given in the movie was very meaningful. Is it right to risk the lives of eight soldiers for the sake of one? Finally, I would like to explain that the movie is of very high quality and offers great viewing pleasure while watching it, but it does not leave a great impression. But there is also a fact that I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has not watched this movie yet.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Sewage like this is the main reason we hate you so much - your sickening, blinkered love affair with yourselves and your stubborn refusal to credit any other nation with any good points at all. Spielberg even had to drop in a disparaging comment about Field Marshal Montgomery, who is still a national hero in England. I'm thankful none of the money I spent on this filth (a pound in a charity shop) will find its way into American pockets. Incidentally, I can't agree with those criticising the portrayal of the Germans. Whether or not individuals were keen to be in occupied countries is irrelevant - they all bore some responsibility for laying waste a whole continent and the murder or enslavement of its population.

This is probably the most realistic on-screen depiction of the horrors that took place at Omaha Beach in Normandy.\nIn terms of audio-visual representation, Spielberg had hit it out of the park in the first twenty minutes alone; nevertheless, the rest of the film was unable to match the highs of the first twenty minutes and fumbled a lot in the middle.

6595b4e5a783f0cdafc9b4d4,tt0120815,Saving Private Ryan,CinemaSerf,2 December 2023,8,"I don't think I can recall any Hollywood film that depicts the atrocities of the D-Day landings as effectively as this does at the start. Indeed, watching it you wonder just how any of the Allied soldiers managed to ever survive the water let alone fight their way up a beach crowded with tank traps, mines and barbed wire - all whilst under constant machine gun fire. Steven Spielberg leaves very little to our imagination and bodies drop left, right and centre with an authenticity that John Williams scores remarkably poignantly. It's during this seemingly impossible assault that we are introduced to ""Miller"" (a career-best from Tom Hanks) and his squad who are tasked with taking out one of the heavily defended pill boxes. Meantime, the US Chief of Staff - General George Marshall is informed that one particular lady is about to get three telegrams in one day telling her that her sons have died. There is a fourth - ""James"" - and the reward for ""Miller"" and what's left of his group is to find this man and get him home to safety. What's also illustrated quite succinctly here is that despite the most meticulous of planning, nobody really has much of a clue who had landed where, who was alive or dead, and whether or not the master plan was working or not! This makes the new task even more difficult as the men, along with the dragooned interpreter ""Upham"" (Jeremy Davis) set of in search of a man they don't know with feelings that can only be described as ""mixed"" about the legitimacy of their mission. What now ensues is a potent story of war and of how the pressures and horrors of constant fear and weariness can corrupt the the most decent of souls. We see these men - decent men - turn into things they would never have thought themselves capable of becoming and the acting really rams that home in a characterful and visceral fashion. Brutality and savagery are not limited to the Nazis and again these images are presented to us with an honesty rather from a rose-tinted good v evil viewpoint and the dialogue has a ripeness and vivacity that rings true, too. It's not devoid of some black humour as we progress through war-torn France before a denouement that combines edge-of-the-seat drama with splendid cinematography and all of the ghastliness of conflict. The men valued each other as much as anything else, their inter-reliance and their determination to get the job done - even if they didn't really know why - is a testament to the attitudes that prevailed throughout the real fighting in Europe during WWII and this dramatisation is stunning. Big screen if you can - but it's really a must watch.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

It's a casino heist movie with zombies, so the best you can call it is sloppy seconds. Las Vegas is overrun by the undead, and Dave Bautista and his assembled team are hired to go into the zombie controlled no man's land to crack a safe and bring back millions before the site gets cauterized with a nuke.\nBautista cuts an imposing physical presence on screen but lacks all the attributes that made Arnold Schwarzenegger excel at this sort of thing. They could've gotten more out of Jesse Ventura if they needed a wrestler for this. Considering it's a Vegas bank heist movie, I would have even preferred Sammy Davis Jr.\nYou get some non-standard zombie action in this one too. In addition to the usual mindless meat eaters, there's also a race of intelligent zombies with the zombie king and queen even engaging in some zombie romance. We actually didn't need that.\nThe overall cast was the most depressing thing about this movie. It's got the typical postomodern team of mercenaries, but these people are so lacking in personality that you won't really care what happens to them. The thing is so cliched you already know who's going to make it out and who won't. Honestly, we did this better in the 1940s war movies where the platoon always had a Ward Bond type as the sergeant, Harry Caray as the blond kid and that wise cracking Italian kid from Brooklyn.

I'm a huge fan of the zombie genre and so I still enjoyed this movie however based on what they achieved with army of thieves there was so much more to be done with this film. There's too many characters to become attached to any of them and the only character I had prior attachment to, Dieter, gets hardly any screen time. Why build such an incredible narrative around him wanting to solve this final safe as his life's work and then not mention once in this film how important it was to him.

The audience first hears Max Steiner's extraordinary score, then, in gigantic letters, the title ""Gone with the Wind"" scrolls across a gorgeous painting of a pasture during a sunset. No other title could have better fit this monumental cinematic achievement.\nAfter the opening credits, the film fades in on a lovely Southern house called Tara, and the audience meets the spoiled teenager Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). Scarlett ignores the surrounding talk about the possibility of an oncoming war, and she instead chases around Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who, to her dismay, is engaged to kindhearted Melanie (Olivia de Havilland).\n""Gone with the Wind"" is a film about pursuing the things that matter, the things that last. When the film begins, Scarlett is an immature young woman who seems to think only about herself and her idealistic image of Ashley. As the effects of the Civil War devastate her homeland, she, with the help of Captain Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), must courageously protect herself and her loved ones. Later, when Butler proposes to her, Scarlett is forced to sort out her priorities. All of this makes for an exciting and engrossing epic.\nOn the other hand, the film has been criticized for its romanticized portrayal of the Confederate South, particularly its depiction of African-Americans. While this is an understandable concern, this assertion overlooks some aspects about the film. Not only does ""Gone with the Wind"" portray an era during which slavery was unfortunately common in the Confederate South, but it portrays that time and place through the eyes of Scarlett, an idealistic and self-absorbed woman. After the Civil War ruins her homeland, Scarlett looks back on life in the Confederate South with wistfulness because that was where her childhood unfolded, and honestly, she seems to make assumptions about everybody she meets. Yes, the scene in which she slaps housemaid Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) in the face is startling, but does she not also slap Ashley in the face because he would not end his engagement to Melanie? While some of the subject matter is ugly, the real beauty of ""Gone with the Wind"" is seeing Scarlett's selfishness eventually dissipate; the audience hopes that she will be a better person tomorrow than she was yesterday.\nNonetheless, Hattie McDaniel deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance as Mammy, who basically commands the film whenever she is onscreen. In fact, the entire cast is excellent, particularly Leigh, Gable, Howard, and de Havilland. So are the cinematography, production design, Steiner's score, and Victor Fleming's direction of the colossal picture.\nIn the end, however, ""Gone with the Wind"" owes most of its success to its exceptional storytelling. Despite its mammoth runtime (nearly four hours), the film hardly ever drags. ""Gone with the Wind"" is a powerful film about fighting for your family when they are in danger, instead of dreaming about a land that has vanished, in the hopes that Tara will still be there tomorrow.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

With a cast of thousands, produced in Technicolor, it also includes one of the most memorable scores ever conducted by Max Steiner. For baby boomers of the 1960s to 1980s who have never seen GONE WITH THE WIND would recognize the scoring best as the introduction to ""The Million Dollar Movie"" on WOR, Channel 9 in New York City. This is where the score and the legend of Scarlett O'Hara all began.\nThe plot, told in chapter form, begins in Tara where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), popular with many suitors as the Tarleton brothers (George Reeves and Fred Crane), but actually Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Ashley loves his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland), whom he intends to marry. Scarlett, daughter of Irish proud plantation owner, Gerald (Thomas Mitchell) and wife, Ellen (Barbara O'Neil), has two other sisters, Coreen (Ann Rutherford) and Suellen (Evelyn Keyes). The O'Hara's also have their Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) who has not only served the family, but becomes an crucial part in Scarlett's life. Before Ashley goes off to serve in the Civil War, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother, Charles (Rand Brooks), who soon makes her a widow. Scarlett becomes the interest of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a man with questionable reputation, having been expelled from West Point. After the war ends, Scarlett, being the sole factor of looking after Melanie and her newborn baby, tries keeping her plantation home from Jonas Wilkerson (Victor Jory) through his high taxing by marrying Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies, leaving Scarlett to take charge of his lumber business. Scarlett's marriage to Rhett Butler and daughter, Bonnie Blue (Cammie King) comes only as his hope for her to change her affections from Ashley to him. Co-starring Ona Munson (Belle Watling); Butterfly McQueen (Prissy); Harry Davenport (Doctor Meade); Jane Darwell, Laura Hope Crews, Isabel Jewell, Alicia Rhett, among many others.\nWhile this production could have been told through two separate movies, with its sequel titled TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY, GONE WITH THE WIND, along with opening and closing overture, has the distinction of being the longest movie (225 minutes) of the 1930s. Some may claim the first half to be better than its second, or visa versa. As much as the plot elements differ from the novel, the final results proved favorable to make this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Along with Academy Award wins, including Best Picture, (Best Actress) Vivien Leigh, (Best Supporting Actresses) Olivia De Havilland and winner Hattie McDaniel), etc., Gable, who was nominated, didn't win. Though nobody can play Rhett Butler best than Clark Gable, a role he was born to play, he being in and out of the story through long stretches may be one of the reasons of his loss. Filled with memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the ones that stand out most the burning of Atlanta; Scarlett becoming prettier through the passage of time; Scarlett's catch phrase of ""Fiddle Dee-Dee,"" but nothing comes off best as Gable's closing line.\nWhen GONE WITH THE WIND first played on commercial television in November 1976, it was a big event, having been reissued in theaters many times after its 1939 release. Distributed on home video in the 1980s and later DVD, it had played on various Ted Turner cable channels, notably Turner Classic Movies since its humble beginning in 1994. Currently restored, TCM is where the movie is going to stay. (****)",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Full of memorable lines and iconic images.\nThe film manages to be immensely entertaining and captivating. It's a film of great strengths, you have patriotism as a theme, Rick so Masculine, Ingrid so feminine it's wonderfully cast. The story takes place in Morocco during WWII, the place were introduced to is a complex one, full of hustlers, spies, secrete police, tricksters, refugees and rumours swirling around. There's also a swell of different nationalities, Arabs, French, Americans, Germans, Czechs and Bulgarians. Rick is brilliant character, tough, sardonic, cynical, witty yet it's also suggested to us this might just be his body armour and underneath is a 'rank sentimentalist.' His life changes when an old flame he very much loved back in Paris walks into his bar in one of the most memorable scenes in cinema. As mentioned the film is so quotable, there's too many good lines to even list. The music is also superb in this film and the scene of the French National Anthem being sung might just be the best one in the film.\nI saw this film for the first time in 4K yesterday and it's just stunning. The level of clarity, depth and detail now in the picture is outstanding, it's like a new film made yesterday almost. It also gives you such a deep appreciation for the cinematography in the film, the use of smoke and shadow and light and contrast, the way light and shadow fall across a characters face, the gleam of their eyes, it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see I think. There's a reason this film is a classic, it's also superbly paced, I don't think there's one wasted scene in the movie, everything works, it's such a well oiled machine in terms of story construction.

6595b4e5a783f0cdafc9b4ed,tt0034583,Casablanca,alekspredator87,19 November 2023,6,"The film ""Casablanca"", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II.\nActing in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity.\nThe picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not.\nDespite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, ""Casablanca"" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that ""Casablanca"" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic.\n6 out of 10.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Much has been said of the film in the past eight decades, and for good reason. Sitting down to watch this classic, I quickly found myself immersed in a bygone era of wartime intrigue and timeless romance, where fedoras were a staple and every shadow held a secret.\nAs the story unfolds, Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick Blaine struck a chord with me-world-weary yet undeniably charismatic. His chemistry with Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund is the stuff of cinematic legend. Their on-screen dynamic balances the desires of their characters perfectly with the realities of war.\nThe supporting cast is a treasure trove of memorable characters. Claude Rains as the charmingly corrupt Captain Renault adds a amusing layer of wit to proceedings, and who could forget Sam's soulful tunes at Rick's Café? The film's dialogue is a masterclass in wit and sophistication, with lines that have etched themselves into the very fabric of movie history. That's even more impressive given that no one involved knew they were making cinematic history. To the screenwriters this was merely one of six films they churned out in 1942.\nCasablanca may be a love story at first glance, but ultimately it's a tale of morality amongst the backdrop of a harrowing time in the world's history. The setting, a melting pot of conflicting interests and cultures, is perfectly captured in the microcosm of Rick's Café. The theme of sacrifice and that haunting, often repeated melody of ""As Time Goes By"" will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.\nIn a world where flashy CGI often steals the show, Casablanca stands tall as a beacon of well-crafted storytelling.

Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blain is masterful in his role, allowing all the subtleties in his performance to make a huge impact in his character progression from a cynic to a 'sentimentalist'. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund brought a charisma and innocence to her role that can make just about anyone fall in love with her. Together their performances brought to life one of the greatest love stories in cinema history.

It's about as good as 1940s movies get, and holds up better than just about any other movie of its age. It's an iconic romance film, an engaging World War II movie made during the middle of World War II, and it's also really funny - it probably provides more laughs through its comedic relief than many comedies do in two hours (The ""What watch?"" ""Ten watch."" ""Such much"" exchange is one of the funniest little throwaway moments maybe ever).\nI remember always liking it, but finding the film surprisingly dense. It moves pretty quickly and has many characters, so it's the kind that's continually rewarding the more I return to it. I think this might've been the fifth time I watched it, and it was at the cinema, which made it even better (it was part 1 of a double feature with The Maltese Falcon second; that one I'm not quite as crazy about).\nHumphrey Bogart is legendary here, all the side characters are great, and it's all very well-paced and manages to successfully navigate a whole range of emotions.

It never cuts so that we see the German pilots in their planes looking down on their targets nor do we see allied generals and politicians in a war room, spoon feeding the audience information. There are only two characters of seniority that really deliver any exposition about the wider context of what's unfolding and even their dialogue is brief. Nolan's approach during the beach and sea sequences is almost equivalent to a camera gliding along the surface through the events as they happen, this gives it a kind of rawness and realism which a more traditionally structured film couldn't do. The focus here is purely on a handful of characters and their life and death struggles, several times machine gun fires rips out from an unseen enemy, just like our characters we never get a good sense of the other side's perspective. The sequences of boats sinking filmed from inside their interiors for me surpasses Tiatnic (1997) in terms of its nightmarish power. There is an amazing close shot of a ship in the inky black of the night lit up by the red and orange of a fireball bursting out of it's hulk.\nHarry Styles is sort of our main protagonist, right from the go he is running for his life. Without much dialogue what we learn about him comes mostly through watching his actions and expressions. He seems to be a perfectly ordinary young man caught up in a horror he couldn't have imagined. For all the ear-piercing noise and hellish fighting some of the most profound moments are the still quiet ones of soldiers stoically waiting their turn, characters sat gazing mournfully at the rough sea, perhaps too exhausted to do anything else, hoping tomorrow they will have better luck. It's a film about people just clinging on, quite literally in several sequences. It's lack of dialogue in favour of visually storytelling is on par with Mad Max Fury Road (2015) another Tom Hardy film.\nWar films can tend to fall into two different kinds of structures, there is the Sands of Iwo Jima/The Dambusters/American Snipper/Hacksaw Ridge kind which introduce you to your character/s, then in the 2nd act take you through their training before the 3rd act is the climactic battle you know has been coming. The other approach is to pretty much open and close the film in the middle of the war, Saving Private Ryan being such a film. Unlike a Oliver Stone movie this doesn't seem to be an anti war theme nor is it a jingoistic affair. Its simple matter of fact approach just tells the story.\nCinematography and Score\nThe score I loved and think it really suited this material. Hans Zimmer does an excellent job of combining traditional score with more ambient sound to create a grittier sounding music than you'd otherwise get.\nThe cinematography does a fine job balancing a filmetic look with at times a more documentary style. There wasn't any excessive colour grading that I could see, it all looked nicely balanced and natural. The film's colour pallet is of course made up of lots of sandy yellow, and khaki green, this fits nicely with the greyer colours of the evening with the blue sea and dark interiors of the ships. The tone of the film is sombre, at times desperate and naturally lacking in any humour or levity. The film was shot on location at Dunkirk at uses thousands of extras as well as real aircraft and ships to create it's impressive sequences. In an age which is increasingly going digital Nolan shot this on real film.\nOther thoughts\nSoldiers of all nationalities in our media and culture can often be portrayed purely in terms of projecting power, impossibly fierce, fearless killing machines. Dunkirk shows us exposed, vulnerable and sometimes frightened traumatised troops stuck in a dire desperate situation. The effect of this choice is characters feel real, not Hollywoodised movie characters who yell out witty dialogue to eachother between reloading or unstoppable baddass types who charge around implausibly dodging bullets while pumping lead into their enemies.\nAs you'd expect part of the story allows time for the civilian effort to rescue soldiers from Dunkirk. Mark Rylance is given a big part here. In a way the film does make you question whether in 2017 a similar response would follow from people in the UK if lots of other people found themselves needing help. If a sense of shared purpose and unity ever existed or such a thing as a national spirit then it's hard to believe it is just as alive and well today. The film also made me question a bit too whether people today would be hard enough to go through something like this. A delay on the M5 the other day had a woman on the news in hysterics over the fact her dogs in back were very hot. Half the audience at the cinema I'm afraid were overweight, mostly dressed in shorts and t-shirts, munching on their food as they watched the men on the screen struggling in the waves. A man in his 50s at the front of the cinema had even stripped down to his vest by the time the film was over, have we become so unhealthy now that sitting down in spacious cinema for two hours can make a person this hot?\nIn terms of negatives with the film, I don't have many. There's quite a lot of cutting between short sequences which I haven't noticed quite so much in Nolan's other work, it was a times a bit grading. I found a bit of the dialogue from Mark Rylance hard to follow, incidentally he probably has the most lines in the film. It's stated to this man lost his son into the third week of the war, not impossible but I'd be surprised considering 1939 was known as the Phoney War, a period of near total inactivity on the Western front.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

War tension, fear, pursuit, shooting. This is not a simple war film, with lots of shots, attacks and shouts of 'Hurray!' No, 'Dunkirk' is a film about the soul, about how war affects the human soul and about what people are capable of when there is no way out.\nThe idea of the plot unfolding from three different angles (land, water, air) is simply amazing and shows us the picture of military operations as broadly and realistically as possible. Thousands of soldiers who are exhausted and dream of only one thing: to return home. Enemy planes targeting ships filled with wounded and water claiming thousands of young lives.\nIncredible cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema conveys human emotions and genuine anxiety. The body shakes from every explosion, from every shot. Close-ups, long shots - everything looked simply unsurpassed and alive.\nThis film is filled with emotions. There is very little text here, but a lot of action. Every movement of the facial muscles is filled with one or another emotion that simply cannot be conveyed in words.\nSeparately, it is worth noting Hans Zimmer and the mood his music gave to the film. Tension, hope, struggle, luck, anger, loss and victory. It was all amplified hundreds of times thanks to the magic of music.\nWhat's really nice is that Nolan, along with famous actors (Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), put young guys at the head of the plot. But the film does not boast of big names, because it is not about individuals. The film tells the story of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and the steadfastness of the people. 'When the soldiers can't go home, the house comes after them' - and it's amazing. Each story told, which ultimately comes together, allows us to feel the tragedy and joy of this historical event.\n'Dunkirk' is a quality film that captures the viewer's imagination and once again reminds us that war is evil.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

The sheer amount of filmmaking artistry to relive the heart-rending moments of Operation Dynamo & the miracle of deliverance thereafter, deserves momentous praise, with its affecting themes conveyed through technical feats over embellishments. The film then honors the fact based stories, and what an achievement it was.\nIn Dunkirk, the esteemed filmmaker captures the perils of war flawlessly, with tantalizing frames that brims with genuine drama, whether from land, sea or air. These frames showcase the most harrowing moments of the escape from Dunkirk, staged to perfection, that the immense fear, hopelessness & desperation of his characters resounds to its audience, without the need for dialogue & expositions. Nolan as well, veers away from manufactured sentimentality & false heroics, guaranteeing a spectacle whose most compelling feats, are in the filmmaker's chosen details. Nolan's directorial marvel peaks further in the RAF Spitfires & German BF Fighters dogfights, whose insane camerawork ushers exhilarating point of views that renders the action as original and authentic as can be.\nApart from the fantastic direction, Dunkirk as well satiates the technical prestige Nolan films are known for. Hans Zimmer's sound design for instance, was impeccable, elevating the spectacles & tension of each riveting plot piece. The cinematography deserves mention as well, with striking images that serves to both dazzle & horrify. The use of practical effects over CGI offers transporting realism, an uncommon treat for war aficionados with a craving for factual representations.\nOverall, Dunkirk is Nolan's honest-to-goodness tribute that showcases the realities of war, and its psychological consequences. It then redefines the genre that is so used to aesthetically pleasing heroes with personal dramas, emotional arcs, & orchestrated valorous deeds.

I feel if they would've fleshed out the characters and had storys and trauma a bit more, it would've had a amazing chance to be up with some of his best works, because in theory Christopher Nolan making a World War II movie sounds amazing but I genuinely cannot tell you any of the characters names and just about nothing happens.

6595b4e5a783f0cdafc9b500,tt8579674,1917,kissin-84936,18 December 2023,9,"1917 is a harrowing journey directed by Sam Mendes that follows two British soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) who are given a critical mission of delivering a message to a battalion of soldiers before their imminent advance on the German forces. From start to finish 1917 reinforces the central themes of the futility of war and its complete insouciance for human life. This is achieved by Chapman and MacKay's commendable performances as they convey both the physical and emotional toils that is war. The camaraderie resulting from their critical mission between the lead cast adds a poignant layer to the narrative of the film and reinforces the film's underlying themes of friendship and sacrifice.\nWhile Chapman's and MacKay's performances should be noted, the deluge of side characters that the main cast encounters offer exceptional performances. Most notably Andrew Scott's ephemeral but highly diverting performance as Lieutenant Leslie. Andrew Scott embodies the pessimistic indifferent lieutenant so common amongst war films and supports the central theme of the film. As Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield prepare to embark upon their journey, Lieutenant Leslie sows doubt among them by way of sarcasm and prayer knowing quite possibly that the chances that Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield are killed are high.\nA most notable aspect of 1917 is its tremendous use of its innovative and seamless single-shot technique made possible by cinematographer Roger Deakins. The seamless single-shot technique creates an immersive experience for the audience by having the film unfold in real time. This technique gravitates the audience towards the chaos and urgency that is so prevalent throughout the film. With moments of silence and intense action all in one shot, the technical marvel achieved with the film elevates it to a masterpiece in editing and camera work.\nAlong with the skillful single-shot technique, Thomas Newman -the film's music composer- blends wonderfully with Mendes' production design. Together, 1917 offers a rich atmospheric experience. Whether the main cast finds themselves navigating no man's land in moments of silence or eluding the gunfire and bombings of war, the music offered creates an emotional impact for the viewer and highlights and brutality of conflict throughout the film.\nOverall, 1917 delivers a cinematic triumph reminiscent of many immersive war films such as Dunkirk (2017) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). 1917 will no doubt leave an indelible mark on the war film genre with its clever use of editing, camera work, and astounding performances while leaving the audience with thought-provoking questions on the futility of war and its brutality.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Thomas Blake is single and unmarried, with an older brother, Joseph (Richard Madden), in the 2nd Battalion. Will Schofield is older and more cynical, having survived the Battle of the Somme in late 1916.\n""1917"" follows the two men on their harrowing journey through No Man's Land and German lines in the next 24 hours, and we learn if the mission was successful. The cinematography is brilliant and very striking, as it appears in the film as two long takes for the entire movie. Chapman and MacKay are superb. The ending is beyond belief but probably necessary in most war movies.\nFortunately, there are no large battle scenes. We only see three or four actual deaths, but they are very personal.

I would say through that this movie is not for anyone under the age of sixteen due to the fact of the amount of violence there is. Of course that is just my opinion.

A story about the crusades, Jerusalem, and the deep conflicts of the medieval world could be romanticised one sided and have no historical clarity, but here, real history and authenticity are given a chance, whilst of course mixing in a degree of dramatic licence and wistfulness. In many ways this is often visceral and balanced in its outlook, sweeping and often spectacular, but the film does have its issues; Orlando bloom is underwhelming in the lead, but just about gets by, and I found the dialogue a little unclear at times, but the theme, the dangers of religious fanaticism, are acutely observed, and the crusaders, a confused rabble with equally confused motives, are portrayed accurately, well balanced by a fair portrayal of the opposing Muslim forces.

But before he leaves, he sees what appears to be his only son Balian (Orlando Bloom) as the village blacksmith and offers him to join them. At first becomes reluctant until he became invoked with rage, killing one of the corrupted monks who stole and wore a necklace once around the neck of his just deceased wife who committed suicide and was supposed to be buried. After running away and eventually catching up with his father, his father becomes gravely injured when a sneak attack came in full circle when the village army were coming to retrieve Balian to stand trial for the murder of one of the so-called monks. The Liam Neeson character eventually dies but as a last resort knights his only son to take his place leaving and telling him that he has ownership of some land somewhere in Jerusalem and wants him to go there. This is where the real the movie starts and I become more tired just watching it! Ridley Scott whose last successful film was ""Gladiator"" solidifying actor Russell Crowe on the map was attempting to redo what he did for him to doing the same type of movie again but with Orlando Bloom is slow, boring and predictable. This film has been done already and it's called ""Gladiator"" why not make something different this time and that's why the film didn't perform well because it's the exact film but with a different setting, using different actors. To pin point the turning point why ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" is similar to ""Gladiator"" is that, although both characters could've chose the path to become great leaders in an uncorrupted and civilized way, they ended up turning it down, allowing the villains or the corrupted to take over resulting to thousands of undeserving needlessly deaths kind of make me hate the main protagonist even more.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,

Both the source novel and the original film convey the ultimate sense that war is futile, on all sides and its widely viewed as the ultimate ant-war story.\nWhere those sources excel is the unwavering simplicity of it all. The book focuses on the troops from the German infantry side but also on how troops were viewed back in Germany both before they went, during and when they came back. It is simple in its narrative but that by no means takes away the message it so skilfully conveys.\nWhere this adaptation excels, is the unsettling no holds barred approach. Unsettling score, bloody close ups, clarity of how futile it all is, and the palpable sense of unfairness for a whole generation.\nIt's not perfect though. For me, the last 40 minutes or so, whilst we'll made, tell us nothing. Veering away from the source text, what we actually get here is a message that has been conveyed many times in war before (that the powers in charge have no sympathy for their men) and it feels like it is trying to say more than it actually does.\nI think whilst this is good, the source novel and original form are perfect.

The film is a harrowing depiction of the senselessness and inhumanity of war, brilliantly capturing the core message of the source material.\nThe film excels in illustrating the sheer absurdity and contradiction inherent in war. It portrays the experiences of young soldiers propelled into the chaos of conflict by ambitions they don't fully comprehend and a sense of duty that becomes increasingly meaningless. The narrative powerfully conveys the idea that war is like an unfathomable fever, illogical yet somehow inevitable.\nOne of the film's most striking aspects is its ability to communicate the horror and utter irrationality of war. It's a poignant exploration of the senselessness of conflict, particularly resonant in the current global climate. The film doesn't just tell a story of war; it immerses the viewer in the visceral reality of the front lines, making the horror and futility felt in a deeply personal way.\nThe adaptation is timely, serving as a stark reminder of the ongoing relevance of Remarque's message. The film's portrayal of the last hours of the war is particularly impactful, showing soldiers being led to slaughter even as the end of the conflict nears. It's a powerful commentary on the ongoing human cost of war, irrespective of its causes or conclusions.\n""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a film that does more than depict historical events; it questions and challenges the very nature of war. It's a necessary and haunting reminder of war's devastating impact on the human spirit and the absurdity of conflict as a means of resolving disputes.

At its core, the film (guided by an accomplished director) masterfully depicts the camaraderie, love, hatred, hubris, egotism, and the sheer stupidity that characterize the theater of war.\nThe camaraderie shared among soldiers in the trenches emerges as a central theme, providing a glimmer of humanity in the darkest of circumstances. The film vividly captures the deep bonds formed between soldiers, bound by a shared struggle and an understanding born of facing death together. Their solidarity becomes a lifeline, offering solace and support in the face of unimaginable horrors. Through the camaraderie, the film showcases the resilience of the human spirit amidst the turmoil of war, highlighting the strength found in unity.\nLove, in its various forms, also finds its place amid the desolation of battle. The longing for normalcy and the enduring power of connections to loved ones left behind. These glimpses of love serve as a reminder of the profound loss experienced by those thrust into the maelstrom of conflict.\nHatred, both for the enemy and the war itself, permeates the narrative. The dehumanization of the enemy becomes a necessary coping mechanism. The internal conflict, torn between duty and revulsion for the senseless bloodshed, exposes the moral ambiguity inherent in warfare.\nHubris and egotism, prevalent not only among commanding officers but also within the ranks, underscore the folly and absurdity of war. The disillusionment experienced by the soldiers, witnessing the callousness and incompetence of their leaders, breeds a profound sense of cynicism. The film skillfully portrays the absurdity of commands issued from afar, divorced from the grim realities faced by those on the front lines, highlighting the tragic consequences of unchecked arrogance and ignorance.\nMoreover, the film does not shy away from depicting the sheer stupidity and futility of war. The juxtaposition of the idealistic fervor that initially drives the young soldiers to enlist with the grim reality they face on the battlefield lays bare the tragic irony of conflict. The systematic destruction of a generation's hopes and dreams through the brutal machinery of war serves as a scathing indictment of the folly of human aggression.\nAll Quiet on the Western Front transcends a mere anti-war narrative but is a timeless commentary on the human condition itself. Its unflinching depiction of the horrors of war, coupled with the exploration of profound themes and the senseless nature of conflict, make our reality true.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b515,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,colonel-13070,23 December 2023,10,"One of the most incredible war stories on film, especially of World War I. It is visceral and intense. It is bloody and full of war horrors. If you want a real depiction of what war is like, and what it does to men in battle, this is a great example of that. World War I was exceptionally bloody based on the style of warfare and the means used to kill the enemy. This is from the German viewpoint. But equally, it shows the human cost. It shows the Germans, like everyone else that was in that theater, our regular people trying to survive from one minute to the next that is often a commonality amongst warriors. This does not get into the history behind the war, and why it started And so forth. This is a human, in the mud, ground level, experience. Nothing to do with generals, making grand decisions, except for a few moments here. It focuses on ground level troops in the infantry, where all the blood and guts are real. Just remake his right up there with the best of all war films.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b516,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,LW-08854,23 December 2023,8,"A film of young men's dreams and illusions of glory and victory horribly crushed.\nThe film opens in freezing woodland with some foxes in their den, the cameras pans down from above the forest and we see it full of dead soldiers while gunfire rings out and the camera glides across the warzone. The film's battle sequences are expertly shot with all the smoke and cloud and rubble and shells landing around the characters. The film is largely told in one large flashback beginning in 1917 with several young friends eagerly joining the army full of high moral. I'm a bit surprised they were in such a state in 1917, 1914 yes but anyway. The production design is great in this film, the streets, the props, the costumes, you don't for a second question any of it. We also experience the battlefields, the ruined villages, the soaking trenches, the music is also brilliant with this hard industrial clanging sound to it as the soldiers march towards the front line. The film is extremely well acted, I saw it in it's original German language and I thought it was really well cast. As well as the experience of the soldiers we also follow a character in 1918 on a mission to bring the war to the end, his role is to negotiate an armistice and has just 3 days to agree to the French terms. The film lets us know this man is fully aware that the lives of all the soldiers still left in the Germany army may rest on his ability to negotiate a surrender. The film does a good job though at hinting at the power struggle taking place within Germany, the Kaiser and the army have effectively be running the country since the war began, and the army leadership is in no mood to compromise, a particularly callous and mad general seems to believe that just one more successful German attack will lead to a breakthrough and the end of the allied advance, even as his army collapses around him he orders more units to the front. The film gets great little details right too like the thinness of the men who are fighting by the end, the mud they often end up caked in when crawling through the trenches, the longing for good food and the thoughts of women and home dominate the lives of these men who are engaged in a fight to the death now. Not all details are perfect though, German soldiers didn't have to run into farms to steal food and then leg it before they were shot, German soldiers were expected and even encouraged to loot French farms and towns which fell under their control and the French were powerless to stop them. The details are horrific, the dead soldiers and horses littering the landscape, men are reduced to almost animal like instincts, thinking only of killing and eating. The wounded engage in a desperate struggle to survive, men carry comrades for miles only for them to die within minutes of safety, again and again we are reminded how futile it all is, some characters are killed unexpectedly, it's all some random. The film is very heavy handed in contrasting the filth and agony the lowly soldiers live with against the command HQ where the general staff live in luxury and comfort. We even get a scene of the general assured that a factory making riddle saddles will have a long and productive future. The not so subtle point is he's a man now with ideas about 50 years out of date. The truth though is both sides did their best to embrace new technology and innovations, no one solution could have ensured a quick victory and a low number of casualties once these mighty great industrial powers were engaged in all out war across such a vast front. The German general worked night and day for 4 years during the war with the weight of the country resting on his shoulders, when his son died in the fighting it broke him, nobody was spared the pain of the war, despite what this film tries to suggest. In this though the mad commander yet again orders his men to the front for one final attack despite everyone knowing it's madness. But then war is madness I suppose is its message.\nI do recommend this film as one of the best WWI films out there in terms of recreating the combat experience, this is a world without women or comfort or even humanity for these men, all that matters is the killing goes on.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b517,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,hollanderne,20 December 2023,9,This movie is overall a very good movie with good story telling and good cinematography while also showing the brutality of war which not a lot of movies show while the movie is a bit disturbing some times it has some moments which are very sad also it hold up pretty good for being a war movie though it can be a little bit unrealistic at times it has most of what a movie needs simply because the people who made the movie they knew what they were doing to make an anti war movie (also if you want to know what an anti war movie is it's basically where it show that war is bad and the lives lost are meaningless.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b518,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,erickcovarrubiaschavarrias,11 December 2023,10,"Personally for me this movie is a well deserved 10 star because of how great this movie was, it had a great plot, good start, good ending, good acting, and good characters. This is the best war movie that i have watched out of all of the ones i saw, it had really close calls and really panicky and tough situations and made you feel at danger and had you really paying attention and the timing for everything was perfect they pulled it off as best as they could, and you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into this movie because they pulled off every scene perfectly and not sloppy. This movie was also very tragic because the main character had to see things that he wouldnt be able to recover from. Honestly this movie was a well deserved 10 star because of how everything just came together perfectly and the movie shocked you more and more even when you thought you saw enough. In all i could say that this movie was magnificent and well deserved 10 star no complaints, its a must watch!",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b519,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,lee_eisenberg,3 December 2023,10,"I've never read Erich Maria Remarque's book, although I've previously seen Lewis Milestone's Academy Award-winning 1930 adaptation starring Lew Ayres. Now I've seen Edward Berger's Academy Award-winning ""Im Westen nichts Neues"" (""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in English). Talk about a gut punch. This movie lays bare the saying ""war is hell"", making clear the futility of war (never mind that the Versailles Negotiations set the stage for World War II). One can see a contrast between the horrors of the battlefield and the generals' comfortable residences. This movie - or the 1930 version - could easily be a double-viewing with Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"".\nAll in all, everyone should see this. With all the wars that have dominated the 21st century, movies like this one become all the more important.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b51a,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,Danielll420,28 November 2023,5,"Ill start off by saying ive read the book before watching this movie.\nIll start with being positive, As a war movie alone, its good,\nbut if you want to call this ""adaptaion"" i wont agree with you, the movie left out alot of good things that the book brought up like the ending scene that was totally different in the book. Also the book let us read the thoughts of paul and what hes going trough which is something you cant put out on a movie.\nIll say that this movie is more ""inspired"" then adapted\nill recommend you to read the book before watching the movie or even after it because its worth it.",6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
6595b4e6a783f0cdafc9b51b,tt1016150,Im Westen nichts Neues,judealexharnett,17 November 2023,7,This was a pretty average World War One movie to be honest. It was pretty depressing and monotone for the whole movie which was really good because thats the kind of atmosphere that should be set for a war movie. Was it an accurate depiction of the last charge? No but it was able to display the horrors and brutal uncompromising and harsh reality of trench warfare. But to be honest the whole movie kinda got a bit muddled in the middle of it and towards the end. Like a lot was going on but nothing was really happening. Also like I didn't like a single character in the whole film which is a bit annoying. 7/10.,6595b2dda783f0cdafc98b52,,,,,
