The first thing I noticed was the radial blur filter laid over half the scenes. Things at the top and bottom of the screen are blurred out for no reason other than to draw attention to what they want you looking at. I couldn't even make it an hour into the film.\\nThe battle scenes, while decently choreographed, were almost entirely bloodless. Stab someone? No blood. No hole. Shoot someone? No blood. No hole.\\nGravity doesn't seem to exist. With a gas giant as your neighbor in the night sky you'd think that would effect all sorts of things including the physiology of the people, animals, plants, and tides.\\nI can't understand how someone could proof read this script and give it a seal of approval.\"}, {'Title ID': 'tt14998742', 'Reviewer Name': 'designs-52603', 'Review Date': '3 January 2024', 'Rating': '1', 'Review': \"Honestly, one of the worst films I've sat through in recent memory, If I hadn't been watching it with family, I'd have turned it off after 20 minutes. After the really bad opening exposition, we're greeted with some really good imagery that is ruined by the horrible creature design of just a Clydesdale horse with a piece of driftwood stuck to its head. But wait, it gets worse once the humans start acting.\\nNo amount of Lens flare can hide the poor writing and bad acting of this movie, though Mr Snyder sure does try. It's almost like someone is making fun of him. The mishmash of cool imagery and stupid imagery just left me feeling confused; why are some shots really great, and others really bad and confusing? Why are some aliens cool, but some are just a horse with driftwood on its head?!\\nThe writing is bad, the pacing is off, and the characters are so flat they disappear when turned sideways. Not even so-bad-it's-good, just plain bad.\"}, {'Title ID': 'tt14998742', 'Reviewer Name': 'matthewialdous', 'Review Date': '3 January 2024', 'Rating': '5', 'Review': 'Overall, the VFX are excellent, especially some of the 3d character performances which are surprisingly good. The costuming and practical sets are excellent. The casting is perfectly good, the acting is good considering the appalling dialogue and story. Unfortunately the whole effort is spoiled by a complete lack of effort on the part of the writers. The \"recruitment story\" is soo completely contrived. ( dues ex machina?? ) the characters are brutally shoe-horned into the story with almost no effort to weave them in organically. I hate to be mean, but it feels like a 15 year old boy wrote the story and dialogue (and noone proof read it for him). Looking back on Jack Snyder\\'s writing credits before this, there is a predicable string of woefully scripted movies (in terms of dialog), wonder woman, 300, justice league etc... Its a real shame if he had employed some skilled writers it could have been a really great sci-fi film. Such a shame, Jack u need to let go of writing, its just not your thing !!'}, {'Title ID': 'tt14998742', 'Reviewer Name': 'christophblak', 'Review Date': '3 January 2024', 'Rating': '3', 'Review': \"It's like Zack Snyder watched Battlefield Earth, and said hey I can make a sci-fi epic worse than that. If you grew up watching the kind of movies that eventually got turned into MST3K episodes, you might be able to finish it. Honestly if the Walking Dead had continued at it's same steady decline in quality this is like what season 38 would be. It is that bad.\\nThose people who give it positive reviews are the people who dug their heels in arguing that Zack Snyder is a director who knows what he's doing. And after all those years they can't admit that they were wrong.\\nThere is going to be a director's cut that fills in the major holes in the plot and story, but the damage is done. Watching it with vital information cut out of it for no reason, make it a confusing, jumbled mess of 1/2 ideas with poor execution. Not many will go back and watch what might be a comprehensible film when the longer cut is inevitably released.\"}, {'Title ID': 'tt14998742', 'Reviewer Name': 'devanwillis', 'Review Date': '3 January 2024', 'Rating': '1', 'Review': 'I\\'ll start with this: after you watch the teasers for this movie, lower your expectations. And then lower them some more.\\nI had high hopes for this movie given Zack Snyder\\'s track record with action and superhero films but this one is out of his grasp. Just like the Star Wars franchise falls from grace, so does this strange ensemble of scenes that were slapped together to make this a so-called movie. At first glance, the casting is appealing but I\\'m not sure this movie did anyone any favors (aside from pushing them to get ripped so they at least look good on screen). The story and movie itself lacked depth and was overall just weak. It\\'s almost like they sat in a room and said \"so we\\'ve done 50 shades of Star Wars, Divergent, Game of Thrones, The Avengers, but what if we try to combine themes from each series and then pepper in some Fifth Element vibes?!\" Also, the fight sequences were terrible. Don\\'t get me wrong, I know it\\'s all fiction, but the reaction time during fight scenes was so unbelievable and the major fight scenes were all borrowed from other movies.\\nI\\'m sure there is certain pressure to bring \"the next best thing\" to our screens when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy film and space opera but this ain\\'t it. And it certainly doesn\\'t make me eager to watch part 2. Zack Snyder needs to take a seat, sit back, and chill on this one.\\nConclusion: go watch Dune.
